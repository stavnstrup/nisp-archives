                  and the problem it is addressing. Following, the solution and derived consequences are
                      described. Finally, the limitations, the deviations and examples are presented.

                           Capability (NNEC), there are four basic challenges which have to be addressed in order to
                           achieve the NNEC requirements that "<span class="emphasis"><em>data, information and services be visible,
                                 accessible, understandable and trusted across the networked environment for all authorized
                                 users, whether anticipated or unanticipated.</em></span>" Each of these challenges build on top
                           of each other - as one challenge is solved, the next becomes relevant as the new challenge to
                           be addressed.

                           strategy goals, known as the NNEC Data Strategy goals, of making data Visible, Accessible,
                           Coherent, Interoperable, and Assured, and their related actions/solution approaches. These
                           solution approaches deal with data and information exchanges across a networked environment,
                           and in particular a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) environment, and thus require
                           standardization of the protocols and data formats to ensure interoperability within the NATO
                           context. As stated in <a class="xref" href="apa.html#one-dot-one-background" title="A.1.1.&nbsp;Background">Section&nbsp;A.1.1</a>, these standardisations are
                           captured by NATO as information exchange STANAGs.

                           current STANAGs that require action to ensure an appropriate interoperability among forces and
                           to enable the information sharing in a seamless infrastructure.

                                5516 consists of more than 8000 pages). These STANAGs are mainly manually written in text
                                using a natural communication language like English, leaving room for (mis-)interpretations
                                and ambiguous definitions (see e.g. standards ambiguity in [MP-IST-01]). To remove the
                                possibility of misinterpretation and ambiguity, verification and validation of the quality
                                and integrity of the STANAG content is required and needs to be supported in an automated
                                way. The text-based representations of the STANAG do not allow this to happen in an
                                efficient and effective manner.

                                implementation of the standards which could lead to interoperability issues when fielded.
                                There is a need for a framework and methodology that supports the transformation of
                                traditional text-based STANAGs into an unambiguous, machine-interpretable format in order to
                                support the automated V&amp;V of STANAG content and implementation quality.

                                in many cases a NATO working group " is responsible for the definition and maintenance of
                                the STANAG based on a well defined process. There currently are limited resources available
                                for the management and maintenance of current STANAGs. In this era where defence budgets are
                                generally in decline with little, if any, prospect for significant improvements, there
                                exists a need to optimize resources to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the

                     <p>261. As part of the multi-year standards transformation effort, NCI Agency (formerly NC3A)
                                developed, under sponsorship of ACT, the STANAG Transformation Framework (STF) to address
                                the identified problem areas and opportunities captured in <a class="xref" href="apas05.html#five-dot-two-problem-areas-and-opportunities" title="A.5.2.&nbsp;Problem areas and opportunities">Section&nbsp;A.5.2</a>. The STF concepts were first
                                introduced in the RTO sponsored Lecture Series on Interoperability in November 2009
                                [RTO-IST-088], and has been further enhanced in detail here. The STF is a framework, a set
                                of design rules and a methodology for transforming traditional text-based information
                                exchange STANAGs into an unambiguous, machine-interpretable XML format and providing a
                                layered approach in addressing the needs for maturing the information exchange STANAGs in
                                the areas identified.

                     <p>262. The standards transformation concept transforms and augments standards by moving
                                towards a more modular composition of the standards differentiating messages structure, data
                                element dictionary, information exchange business rules and other aspects. To fulfil the
                                emerging NNEC requirements, the current standards will be augmented with additional
                                specifications, such as security cross-domain information exchange definitions.
                     </p>
                     <p>263. Moreover, the transformation of current standards towards machine-interpretable
                                standards is foreseen as part of the standards transformation concept. The expanding
                                exploration and application of XML into the realm of information exchange is viewed as a
                                major step in support of NNEC. An evolving framework for capturing information exchange
                                specifications in XML is a key element in advancing this technology. As that framework
                                matures it is imperative that it adopts a model which fully supports all types of
                                information exchanges, i.e. binary-, text- and XML-based formats. This will improve quality,
                                maintainability and integrity of the standards and therefore contribute to the NNEC
                                Networking and Information Infrastructure (NII) by improving interoperability.
                     </p>
                     <p>264. A common framework and methodology applicable to all STANAGs, which are related to the
                                technical interoperability between systems/services, was developed. The combination of the
                                two will allow the NNEC Data Strategy goals to be addressed and they will facilitate the
                                implementation of it from a standardization perspective.

                  <p>266. Leveraging the successful application of the layered approach similarly to that of the
                           ISO OSI reference model, the STF is defined using a layered approach to identify and capture
                           the different areas of the information exchange STANAGs that should be specified in order to
                           support various levels of interoperability. The STF layers have been identified based on the
                           analysis of current Information Exchange Requirements and Specifications and emerging
                           requirements for information sharing. The STF defines clear interfaces between the layers,
                           supported by machine-interpretable XML specifications, design rules and a methodology to apply
                           them, in order to support the identification, capture and reuse of specifications within those
                           layers to support information exchange interoperability.

                  </div><br class="figure-break"><p>268. As can be seen, the STF defines five stacked horizontal layers and three vertical
                           layers.
                  </p>
                  <p>269. The application of the STF layers towards STANAG transformation is based on the intended
                           use and need to support interoperable information exchange within different domains.
                  </p>
                  <p>270. The horizontal STF layers could be considered Mandatory; their specifications are needed
                           to support interoperable information exchange within a domain. However, a particular system
                           implementation might not need to provide all functionalities described within the STANAG--the
                           functionalities might be implemented by various systems, each playing a different role within
                           the functional scenario. Therefore, the deployment or implementation of a system might cover
                           only a subset of the layers to cover their needs and roles. This way the minimum
                           implementation requirements for each system to achieve interoperability within a functional
                           scenario must specify the requirement to implement parts of each layers to fulfil a specific
                           role in a functional scenario.
                  </p>
                  <p>271. On the other hand, the vertical layers could be considered Optional specifications based
                           on the intended use and functional scenario. In particular, if it is determined that there is
                           a need to support the exchange of information across different security domains, then the
                           specifications to support that information exchange has to be captured at the Security
                           Cross-Domain layer. If it is envisioned that there is a need to support the exchange of
                           information utilizing web services, then the Web Services specifications have to be captured
                           using the Web Services layer. And finally, if it is deemed necessary to support the exchange
                           of information across operational domains, it is necessary to map and specify how that
                           information exchange will occur between those domains using the Operational Cross-Domain
                           layer.
                  </p>
                  <p>272. The horizontal layers leverage concepts that can be loosely mapped to the <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iso_osi" target="_top">ISO OSI 7-layer model</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcp/ip" target="_top">TCP/IP stack</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol" target="_top">communication protocol</a>
                           specifications.
                  </p>
                  <p>273. The first two horizontal layers, "Data bearer" and "Routing", deal with physically and
                           logistically "how" the information exchange is occuring between two systems. These two layers
                           can be mapped to the lower 5 layers of the OSI model or the lower 2 levels of the TCP/IP
                           stack, namely the Physical and Data Link layers, and the Network, Transport and Session
                           layers. These deal with getting the data between any two or more systems that need to
                           interoperate with each other.
                  </p>
                  <p>274. The top three horizontal layers defines "what" is being exchanged and the "rules" for
                           exchanging those messages between two or more systems. These layers map loosely to the data
                           defintion, data syntax, data semantics and data synchronization concepts used to define
                           communication protocols at the Application layer of the OSI and TCP/IP stack.

                           types of information exchanges. The machine-interpretable XML specifications provide, where
                           required, support for the different types of exchanges by defining a specific adapter of the
                           XML Schema Definition (XSD). In the case of XML-based information exchanges the STF will
                           leverage on the existance of a compliant XSD governing the information exchanges augmented
                           with further required information.

                                     specific Community of Interest (COI), leading to the development of ad-hoc vocabularies to
                                     fulfil their immediate requirements. The data elements definitions are specifically
                                     oriented to the COI with direct impact on quality within the COI specific network and
                                     interoperability with other COI specific systems, with little to no consideration of
                                     existing STANAGs within or between other COIs.
                        </p>
                        <p>303. This typically results in a lack of interoperability both within the COI (because of
                                     the availability of multiple COI specific standards) and between COIs.
                        </p>
                        <p>304. The Operational Cross-Domain layer is provided to capture those information exchange
                                     specifications between COIs or STANAGs at the necessary levels as identified in the
                                     horizontal layers.
                        </p>
                        <p>305. For example, the data elements defined within two COIs' information exchange
                                     specifications could be fully overlapping, disjointed or partially overlapping. It is
                                     essential to associate these data elements and their relationships based on the context
                                     and content of the information exchange in order to achieve interoperability between the
                                     COIs. The mapping and harmonization of semantically the same data elements and the
                                     association of similar data elements has to be captured.

                     <p>309. The definition, application and V&amp;V of the STF layers, design rules and
                                methodology is an on-going process that is handled by the iterative process captured in
                                <a class="xref" href="apas05.html#v5a-f10" title="Figure&nbsp;A.10.&nbsp;STF - Holistic Process">Figure&nbsp;A.10</a>. This is a Holistic Process that can be applied to the STF itself
                                as well as for the application of the STF in transforming textual IESs into XML. There are
                                explicit points identified for feedback to the STF and IER/IES Stakeholders for possible
                                improvements of their products.
                     </p>
                     <p>310. For STF Version 1.0, the STF Holistic Process is depicted below. It is anticipated
                                that this Process will be expanded for future versions as additional STF layers are matured
                                and provided. For example, once the Business Rules layer has been expanded upon, an
                                additional step will have to be added to cover that layer.

                                                  Services, then a specification for the Web Services STF layer would be necessary).
                                                  Based on these needs, identify existing Standards (IESs) that could fulfill those
                                                  needs. With the STF layered approach, one may find that the same IESs can be reused to
                                                  fulfil multiple types of IERs as well as find that there will be missing IESs that

                                vocabulary, of the Information Exchange STANAG.
                     </p>
                     <p>315. In general, there are different types of Information Exchanges that can occur which
                                can be categorized based on the way the data being exchanged between systems is represented.
                                In particular, within the STF, the following three types have been identified-- bit-based,
                                text based and XML-based, the last being a highly-structured text based information
                                exchange.
                     </p>
                     <p>316. The STF Data Element Dictionary layer has been defined in such a way that it is
                                applicable to all types of information exchanges. The machine-interpretable STF-related XML
                                specifications provide, where required, support for the different types of exchanges by
                                defining a specific adapter of the XML Schema Definition.

                        <p>318. As considered by ISO/IEC 11179, there are three main relationships related to
                                     semantic theory and the basic principles of data modelling that should be addressed when
                                     identifying, defining and grouping data elements. These are the following:
                        </p>
                        <div class="itemizedlist">
                           <ul class="itemizedlist">

                              <li class="listitem">

                                     Dictionary layer. The third relationship can be captured either in the Data Element
                                     Dictionary or in the Message Structure layer (see below).

                                     slightly different, but related meanings:

                        <p>322. Within STF, the context, or the third data modelling relationship, can be captured
                                     either explicitly as a different Data Element or implicitly as a data field within the
                                     Message Structure layer. The reason for this is that, often, the specific meaning of a
                                     Data Element could be provided by how it is being used (i.e. Latitude of target vs
                                     Latitude of shooter). However, the context could also describe the environment in which
                                     the data element exists (i.e. Latitude is a data field within the Target Position
                                     Message). This could be considered a different usage, hence a different Data Element, but
                                     not necessarily so.
                        </p>
                        <p>323. Furthermore, the type of Information Exchange may have impact on the way the Data
                                     Element Concept and Data Elements are defined as e.g. the different representations of
                                     bit-based Information Exchanges might be considered different uses.
                        </p>
                        <p>324. For the purpose of the STF and to support reuse and data harmonization, it is highly
                                     recommended that the end user captures the context relationship within the Message
                                     Structure layer rather than as an explicit data element.

                        <p>325. <span class="bold"><strong>Data Element Concept/Data Elements</strong></span></p>
                        <p>326. These are two related concepts within the STF Data Element Dictionary layer that
                                     capture the first two relationships. The <span class="bold"><strong>Data Element
                                           Concept</strong></span> maps to the generic, "conceptual" concept while the <span class="bold"><strong>Data Elements</strong></span> map to the more specific, "concrete" concepts. In
                                     particular, the Data Elements in the STF DED are organised based on a thesauri, in support
                                     of the Data Coherence goal of the NNEC Data Strategy, whereby the Data Element Concepts
                                     group together semantically equivalent data elements that might be represented within a
                                     STANAG using different terminology and/or granularity. Different possible instantiations
                                     of a Data Element Concept are described with the use of one or more Data Elements.
                        </p>
                        <p>327. <span class="bold"><strong> Data Element </strong></span></p>
                        <p>328. A Data Element captures a specific concept with a specific representation, and
                                     possibly with a specific usage. It is the atomic unit of data that has a precise meaning
                                     and precise semantics for that domain. Such a data element can be stored or exchanged
                                     between computer systems.

                                                  example, a Scale Indicator Data Element might control that the Altitude Data Element
                                                  is reporting the altitude in multiples of 100 or 500 feet increments. This construct
                                                  is especially used in the binary information exchanges for space optimization.

                                     view. For instance 'Latitude Degrees Minutes Seconds' and 'Latitude Decimal Degrees' both

                                     specify that the encoding/decoding of a DataElement depends on the value of another
                                     DataElement. For example, an Altitude DataElement has a value of 5 which means an actual
                                     altitude of either 5 meter or 50 meter, indicated by the value of an Altitude Scale
                                     Indicator DataElement. Such a construct is typically used within bit-based information
                                     exchanges for space efficiency. Note that the <span class="bold"><strong>CodingSwitch</strong></span> can be nested for the situation where the coding is
                                     dependent on multiple data elements.

                        </div>
                        <p>383. Step 1: Determine which type of message exchange (bit-based fixed length, bit-based
                                     variable length, text-based or XML-based). Based on this, determine the correct STF XML
                                     artefact to use and the XML namespace to use for the MS XML instance document that will be
                                     created to define the information exchange message structures. Bit-based, text-based and
                                     XML-based types each have their own XML namespace.
                        </p>
                        <p>384. Step 2: Identify all messages to be exchanged.</p>
                        <p>385. Step 3: For each message, identify the grouping constructs. Depending on the format,
                                     terms like word, group, set, container, segment, PDU, etc. may be used.
                        </p>
                        <p>386. Step 4: For all identified grouping constructs, determine how they should be mapped
                                     to the 'Word' abstract concept in the STF MS XML Schema. The mapping does not need to be
                                     one-to-one. For example, extra words may be added if they are necessary to group repeated
                                     fields even though the specification of the format does not group them.
                        </p>
                        <p>387. Step 5: For each message, determine the data fields that make up the message using
                                     data elements captured within the STANAG-specific DED XML from <a class="xref" href="apas05.html#data-element-dictionary-layer-design-rules-and-methodology" title="A.5.5.4.&nbsp;Data Element Dictionary Layer Design Rules &amp; Methodology">Section&nbsp;A.5.5.4</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>388. Step 5a: If there is a need within a particular message for a StructureSwitch, then
                                     for each "switch" pattern, determine the conditions that control the switch.
                        </p>
                        <p>389. Step 6: Identify all properties of the messages, groupings (words) and data fields,
                                     such as DECI and DEI number, name, title, purpose, remarks, start bits if appropriate,
                                     fixed and value.
                        </p>
                        <p>390. Step 7: Create the XML instance document representing the MS, according to the
                                     appropriate XML Schema selected in Step 1.

                           essential to plan the implementation of the guidance from a holistic approach. This means the
                           approach needs to achieve improvements which are both efficient and effective. The approach
                           should be modular to enable to re-use, while a spiral approach will allow for continual
                           learning and improvement. The following key success factors for the STANAG transformation need
                           to be considered.

                                multiple perspectives. One of the main aspects of efficiency is to enhance the cost
                                effectiveness by reducing manual labour. The reduction of manual labour will also provide an
                                advantage by reducing time in STANAG development and maintenance. In particular, this will:

                     <p>410. The use of the layered approach is a wide-spread and well-known concept that has been
                                used for years and successful application can be found in the OSI reference model for
                                communication protocols and semantic web interoperability. The adoption of this layered
                                approach introduces multiple benefits:

                                             separation between the different functional areas addressed by the STANAG. The ability

                                             their unclear and tangled definitions. By untangling these functionalities and
                                             presenting them within a layered approach, the different functionalities can be verified

                     <p>412. Current and future operations require and will require interoperability at all levels:
                                from machine-to-machine, to human-to-human via all the transformation steps from data to
                                information. The essential pre-requisite is standardization and well-defined and error-free
                                standards, which are machine-interpretable for ease of implementation and with no
                                opportunity for mis-interpretation. Using the traditional approach to standardisation will
                                continue to produce standards that are difficult to maintain and often contain errors,
                                entail long delays before ratification, are ambiguous, and therefore result in
                                non-interoperable systems. The new approach proposed in this document applies to five areas:
                                The application of the layered approach, the configuration management of the standards, the
                                development of systems, the actual interoperability, and the enhanced operational usage in
                                the future. The benefits provided in each of these areas are further addressed in the

                        <p>413. The current configuration management (CM) of the various STANAGs is handled by their
                                     respective custodians (e.g. Defence Information Systems Agency (DISA) for STANAG 5516)
                                     using different proprietary tools and methodologies. The process of creating a new STANAG
                                     baseline is largely a manual task where changes to the STANAG text are applied to the
                                     proper sections; some of the text is maintained in a database as structured data (e.g. the
                                     Message Structure and Data Element Dictionary), others are maintained as a collection of
                                     plain text (e.g. the body text or the transmit and receive rules). Linkage between one
                                     baseline of a STANAG and a previous one is difficult. Furthermore, various STANAGs need to
                                     maintain consistency between them, e.g., those defining different Data Links and those
                                     that define the conversions between them, or STANAGs and standards which define common
                                     elements (e.g. positional definitions or identities (STANAG 1241)).

                                     of STANAGs in a machine-interpretable format which is structured and well-defined. Several

                                     greatly improved because of the resulting consistency in internal structure and phrasing,

                                     enhancements, the improved standard would provide ways to create references on several

                                     Proposal (CP) process. CPs are developed and then submitted by Nations and Strategic
                                     Commands (SC) represented in the body responsible for the CM of the STANAG in order to
                                     modify parts of the STANAGs. CPs could correct errors in the STANAGs or could introduce
                                     changes in order to implement new capabilities. As soon as agreement has been reached the
                                     CP and supplement sections will be embedded in the next edition of the STANAG.

                        <p>420. A structured, well-defined, machine-interpretable standard can be used in various
                                     ways. Generation of human readable documentation is one of the most self-evident ones,
                                     which could also provide more capabilities than the current human readable standard by
                                     using the information provided by the structure. But because of the machine-interpretable
                                     aspect of the new specification, it's strength is most prominent when it is used as the
                                     base for the implementing system's logic i.e., using the specification to generate the
                                     system's implementation. In traditional systems, humans read the standard and implement
                                     the desired functionality. This is manual work to a large extent without real support for
                                     automation. Often engineers will convert certain aspects of the standard to some sort of
                                     structured information but each group is basically reinventing the wheel. Furthermore,
                                     besides being time-consuming and error-prone, it also requires the human to interpret
                                     thousands of pages of text, not always in their native language, while keeping track of
                                     the intrinsic linkage between the various sections of the standard. Undoubtedly each
                                     company or agency will have developed their own ways of tracking the quality of their work
                                     with linkage back to the specification which is a huge effort and therefore represents
                                     concrete value and is therefore not easily shared among companies or agencies.
                        </p>
                        <p>421. Transforming the specification so it can be interpreted by a machine would mean a
                                     huge reduction of human interpretation. This can be achieved by defining only a limited
                                     and well-defined vocabulary instead of the many ways a natural language can be used to
                                     express, e.g., the logic of a system. Different ways of expressing the same thing might be
                                     pleasant while reading a novel but will trigger an engineer's brain to wonder whether the
                                     different wording might indicate a different behaviour. This is even more applicable when
                                     the language at hand is not the engineer's native language.
                        </p>

                                 <p>The level of interpretation will be reduced because of the limited and

                                                  great accuracy and because there is only a limited set, it will be easier to

                                                  well-defined and repetitive way. That is obviously something a machine is aimed

                                     together with the increased power and quality of the specification, will have several
                                     positive effects on the resulting product:

                                                  and update the relevant code. In the best case it would be a push-on-a-button to

                                     essential in order to achieve situational awareness according to the NNEC Data Strategy.
                                     This is especially true in a NATO environment where various nations are collaborating with
                                     their own national systems, often developed by different companies and with different
                                     requirements. Interoperability shall be verified during various stages of the system's
                                     life, each of which can leverage on the machine-interpretable standard.

                                     documents against each other; the system's requirements document (SRD) or the interface
                                     control document (ICD) against the standard. By capturing the SRD and the ICD in XML in a
                                     similar manner to that foreseen for the TDL standard itself, automatic assessment of
                                     interoperability against the standard or another system can be easily achieved. This has a
                                     direct positive effect on both the quality of the comparison as well as the time it takes.
                                     The paper-based interoperability assessment between the SRD and the standard can be
                                     performed even before the system is actually built, reducing the costs associated with
                                     later changes. An example of such an interoperability assessment via machine interpretable
                                     versions of both the reference document and the ICD can be found in

                                     implementation system, as explained in the previous section, will positively affect the
                                     level of interoperability between these systems. The level of interpretation is reduced
                                     because of the well-defined constructs and the limited number of constructs, while the
                                     amount of interpretation is reduced because of applying these constructs consistently over
                                     the whole standard. Furthermore, if a system interprets a certain construct in a
                                     non-standard way (i.e. a bug), this would affect all situations where it is applied which
                                     therefore increases the chance of discovering this during tests.

                                     but also test and analyzer tools can be generated to a large extent. The specification
                                     will contain all the information like the supported messages, their structure and the
                                     protocol for the message exchange. These tools can then be used to rigorously test systems
                                     against the standard, both in a one-on-one test and for analyzing the interaction between
                                     different systems.

                        <p>429. The introduction of machine-interpretable standards will significantly increase the
                                     interoperability between systems whose implementation has been derived from the same
                                     standard; it will eliminate the need for ad-hoc interfaces and translation of data
                                     structures. To ensure interoperability between the systems based on different standards
                                     from different COIs, COIs should harmonise their information exchanges and establish
                                     common agreed upon operational cross-domain specifications. In the past, this process was
                                     often tedious for various reasons, but it is foreseen that this process can be facilitated
                                     by the application of the STF and the availability of the future NMRR capability to store
                                     and manage those specifications. More information about standardization, the power of
                                     metadata, such as the machine-interpretable standards, and the role of the NMRR, can be
                                     found in [NC3A-TN-1254] [RTO-EN-IST-088].
