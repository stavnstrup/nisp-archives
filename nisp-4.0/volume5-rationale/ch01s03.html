      applied to all services that are candidates for inclusion in the
      NISP.</p>
                     <div class="sect2" title="1.3.1. Standardization Requirement">

                              </div>

                        <p>15. For system to system interoperability the NISP should
        standardize only those services that are relevant to an achievable
        level of interoperability between NCF systems and between NCF systems
        and the systems or NII of Coalition partners.</p>
                        <p>16. There are many NNEC services that are or could be routinely
        provided within a national NII or an individual system, but which are
        not relevant to NATO or to a nation's interoperability. An example of
        the latter might be a distributed print service (i.e. the ability of
        one computer to issue a print job to a networked printer or to another
        computer for spooling). This principle states that services not
        relevant to NCF interoperability or System to system's
        interoperability should be excluded from the scope of the NISP.</p>
                        <p>17. For NCF systems or NII the NISP should only standardize those
        services for which there is clear requirement and that would deliver
        significant benefit when balanced against the reduction in diversity
        that such standardization would promote.</p>
                        <p>18. The standardization of services within NCF systems or NII should
        only be applied when there is a clear need for a particular service.
        For a service to be standardized, the potential benefits of
        standardization such as avoidance of vendor lock-in must outweigh the
        risks of a possible limited market support.</p>
                        <p>19. The NISP should only standardize services when there is evidence
        of a present or near term requirement for such standardization.</p>
                        <p>20. The scope of the NISP, in terms of the services it specifies,
        will inevitably change over time. There is a temptation to standardize
        services just in case a future requirement for their use should arise.
        Although there may be instances where such pre-emptive action is
        beneficial, the main effect of such a policy is to foster unnecessary
        standardization.</p>
                        <p>21. The NISP should standardize services only where there is
        sufficient scale of benefit to be gained.</p>
                        <p>22. There are many standard services that could be potentially
        beneficial to NCF systems, NII, or in achieving system to system
        interoperability but their applicability is limited to particular
        functional niches or the services are needed only by small groups of
        systems. Unless there is clear benefit from widespread standardization
        across the NII (with the potential cost and risk penalties of
        enforcement), the NISP should be silent and the specification of
        standard services left to a more local level.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>23. The NISP should use only open<sup>[<a id="d0e193" href="#ftn.d0e193" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup> standards wherever possible when attempting to standardize a service.</p>
                        <p>24. Products exist that allow IT systems to exchange a wide range of services to achieve a high degree of interoperability; however, some open standards include vendor specific extensions. Therefore it is essential that products be validated against the open standards.</p>
                        <p>25. Ideally, standardization of a service should only be undertaken
        where there is an effective open solution. However, there will remain
        circumstances where effective open solutions do not exist, yet the
        business benefits of standardization would be significant<sup>[<a id="d0e201" href="#ftn.d0e201" class="footnote">2</a>]</sup>.</p>
                        <p>26. The following criteria are suggested to determine whether or not
        a solution qualifies as being acceptably open from a NISP
        perspective:</p>

            must be wide spread market support for the standard. Among
            competing standards it should be the dominant standard and it
            should have a substantial share of the market;</p>

                        <p>27. Existing standards and profiles implemented in legacy systems should be
        preferred if they are equal to other candidate standards.</p>
                        <p>28. There are two reasons why standards already implemented in
        legacy systems might be preferred: first, they are demonstrated to
        work and have an experience base; second, and more importantly,
        migration of legacy systems to a new standard could be infeasible or
        prohibitively expensive. Standards that are already implemented should
        form a starting point, unless these are judged no longer appropriate.
        Subject to their continuing validity, this will lead to a preference
        for standards implemented in legacy systems. This principle ensures
        that change is not made purely for the sake of change: however, the
        NISP is in essence a forward-looking document that should also
        indicate the (non-legacy) target standard for migration (embodied
        later in the system evolution principle) to a more current standard
        and level of capability.</p>

                        <p>29. For interoperability services, national procurement agencies are
        encouraged to use the NISP standards, however this should not
        unacceptably interfere with legitimate national project management or
        procurement freedoms.</p>
                        <p>30. The objectives of the NISP require that certain services be
        standardized across NCF systems and the NII and facilitate
        interoperability with national NII. However, national projects will
        need to be individually responsible for specifying national
        requirements and managing the risks associated with their
        implementation. NISP standardization aspirations for national systems
        must therefore be moderated by genuine needs for national project
        management and control.</p>
                        <p>31. For NCF systems and the NII the NISP should not standardize
        services that would interfere with competitive open bidding.</p>

In some cases an acceptably open standard may include MIL-STDs, STANAGs and other non-commercial            standards.</p>

            commercial market has no widely accepted open standards but the
            business benefits of achieving interoperability in this area are
            great. In this case the NISP has selected the Microsoft Office
            formats for interoperability.</p>
