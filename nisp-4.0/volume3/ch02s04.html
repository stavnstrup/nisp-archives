                     <p>93. The "Cloud" in Cloud computing describes a combination of
      inter-connected networks. This technology area focuses on breaking up a
      task into sub-tasks. The sub-tasks are then executed simultaneously on
      two or more computers that are communicating with each other over the
      &#8220;Cloud&#8221;. Later, the completed sub-tasks are reassembled to form the
      completed original main task. There are many different types of
      distributed computing systems and many issues to overcome in
      successfully designing one. Many of these issues deal with accommodating
      a wide-ranging mix of computer platforms with assorted capabilities that
      could potentially be networked together</p>

                           <strong>Implications</strong>
                        </span>: The main goal of a
      cloud computing system is to connect users and resources in a
      transparent, open, and scalable way. Ideally this arrangement is
      drastically more fault tolerant and more powerful than many combinations
      of stand-alone computer systems. If practiced in a NATO environment,
      member nations would consume their IT services in the most
      cost-effective way, over a broad range of services (for example,
      computational power, storage and business applications) from the
      "cloud," rather than from on-premises equipment.</p>

        access to computing resources, ushering in an era in which, among
        other things, startups can operate with much lower infrastructure
        costs. Instead of having to buy or rent hardware, users can pay for
        only the processing power that they actually use and are free to use
        more or less as their needs change. However, relying on cloud
        computing comes with drawbacks, including privacy, security, and
        reliability concerns.</p>

          designed to make web-scale computing easier for developers. If your
          application needs the processing power of 100 CPUs then you scale up
          your demand. Conversely, if your application is idle then you scale
          down then amount of computing resources that you allocate.</p>

                        <p>102. Grid computing is the collective name of technologies that
        attempt to combine a set of distributed nodes into a common resource
        pool. The term grid computing stems from an analogy with electric
        power grids that combine a large set of resources (power plants,
        transformers, power lines) into simple well defined product (the power
        outlet) that the user can use without having to know the details of
        the infrastructure behind it.</p>
                        <p>103. Typical for grid computing is also that it offers a framework
        for management of node memberships, access control, and life cycle
        management. Common applications of grid computing allow well defined
        organisations to share computational resources or storage resources so
        that resources may be used efficiently and resource demanding tasks
        can be performed that would otherwise have required large specialised
        and/or local investments.</p>

                        <p>104. While some grid computing systems have been designed for a
        specific purpose, some standards for Grid infrastructure have also
        evolved that make the task of setting up a Grid easier and provide a
        common interface to application developers. Such standardisation
        efforts have resulted in Globus Toolkit [51] and OGSA (Open Grid
        Services Architecture) [53].</p>
                        <p>105. The Global Grid Forum (GGF) [52] is a set of working groups
        where much work on grid computing standardisation is ongoing, and that
        also is behind the OGSA standard. Their web site is a good source of
        information about ongoing work in the field and examples of grid
        projects.</p>

          builds on a combination of Globus Toolkit [51] (developed by the
          Globus Alliance [50]) and Web service technologies to model and
          encapsulate resources in the Grid. A number of special Web service
          interfaces are defined by OGSA that support service management,
          dynamic service creation, message notification, and service
          registration. A number of implementations of OGSA have been made,
          including for example OGSI (Open Grid Services Infrastructure) and
          WSRF (Web Services Resource Framework, developed by OASIS [47]).
          Today, WSRF is the chosen basis for further development of
          OGSA</p>

                           <p>108. OSGi is a standard for a framework for remotely manageable
          networked devices [25]. Applications can be securely provisioned to
          a network node running an OSGi framework during runtime and thus
          provides the possibility to dynamically manage the services and
          functionality of the network node. The OSGi model is based upon a
          service component architecture, where all functionality in the node
          is provided as "small" service components (called bundles). All
          services are context aware of each other and heavily adapt their
          functionality depending on what other services are available.
          Services must degrade gracefully when the services they depend upon
          are not available in the framework. These network nodes are designed
          to reliably provide their services 24/7/365. Adding an OSGi Service
          Platform to a networked node/device adds the capability to manage
          the life cycle of the software components in the device. Adding new
          services thus makes it more future proof and gives the node
          flexibility.</p>
                           <p>109. OSGi adopts a SOA based approach where all bundles deployed
          into an OSGi framework are described using well defined service
          interfaces. The bundle uses the framework's name service for
          publishing offered services and to retrieve services needed by the
          bundle itself. OSGi works well together with other standards and
          initiatives for example Jini or Web Services. OSGi is also an
          example of a technology where integration is carried out in the Java
          environment but the actual implementation of the services can be
          written in other languages, such as C.</p>

                        <p>110. Another trend in distributed system is to decrease the
        dependence on centralised resources. A centralised resource is
        typically some service of function implemented by dedicated nodes in
        the distributed system that many of or all other nodes depend on to
        perform their own services or functions. Examples of such services are
        shared databases, network routing and configuration functions, and
        name or catalogue services. Obviously, this may cause dependability
        problems as the centralised server becomes a potential single point of
        failure (). From some points of view, decentralisation (i.e To
        decrease the dependence single nodes), is therefore a property to
        strive for. However, decentralisation may also result in a (sometimes
        perceived) loss of control that fits poorly with traditional ways of
        thinking of, for example, security. Decentralisation can thus have a
        rather long-reaching impact on the way distributed systems are
        designed.</p>
                        <p>111. Taken to its extreme, decentralisation strives for distributed
        systems where all nodes are considered equal in all respects (except
        of course their performance and capacity), i.e., all nodes are
        considered to peers. This is the foundation to peer-to-peer (P2P)
        systems, which will be discussed later. In such systems,
        decentralisation is realised by offering mechanisms to maintain a
        global shared state that is not stored by any single node.</p>

                           <p>112. Peer-to-peer, or P2P for short, is a technology trend that has
          received much attention in recent years. Unfortunately, much of this
          attention has been oriented towards questionable applications of
          P2P, such as illegal file sharing, rather than towards its merits as
          a technology that addresses important problems with traditional
          distributed systems.</p>
                           <p>113. The fundamental idea behind P2P is, as is implied by its name,
          that all participating nodes in a distributed system shall be
          treated as peers, or equals. This is a clear deviation from the
          client/server concept, where some nodes play a central role as
          servers and other nodes play a role as clients. In those systems,
          the server nodes become critical for the system function, and thus
          need to be dependable, highly accessible, and dimensioned to handle
          a sometimes unpredictable workload. Obviously this may make a server
          node both a performance bottleneck and a dependability risk. P2P
          addresses such problems.</p>

                           <p>114. The fundamental important property of many P2P applications is
          that they allow storage of named objects, such as files, services,
          or database entries, to be spread over all nodes in a system instead
          of having to store and access them on centralised server nodes.
          Object names can be numbers or character strings; whichever is
          appropriate for the applications. Once stored in the system, any
          node can access a named object just by knowing its name. This means
          that a P2P system can have a global shared state that does not
          depend on any centralised node.</p>
                           <p>115. While in principle avoiding a centralised solution, many early
          P2P systems, such as the Napster file sharing system actually relied
          on some central functions in order to implement the mapping from
          object names to object locations. However, in later generations of
          P2P decentralisation has been taken another step further, by the
          introduction of overlay networks, earlier in this report mentioned
          as a form of virtual networks.</p>
                           <p>116. With an overlay network, a distributed means of finding the
          node that is responsible for storing an object with a given name is
          provided. Typically the set of all possible object names, called the
          name space, is divided into subsets such that each node becomes
          responsible for one subset of the name space. This means that the
          need for centralised resources is completely avoided. For a node to
          become part of a P2P system, i.e. To join the overlay network, all
          that is needed is knowledge of any other node already part of the
          system. As nodes join and leave the system, the responsibility for
          name space subsets is automatically redistributed.</p>
                           <p>117. The development of overlay network based P2P systems has been
          driven by a striving to improve scalability, guarantees, and
          robustness. Today, a logarithmic logical scalability can be
          achieved, which means that to find a given node from any other node
          in the system requires at most logk(N) node-to-node messages to be
          sent, where k is some constant and N is the maximum number of nodes
          in the system. Note, however, that this scalability measure does not
          automatically translate into an exact measure of the actual time it
          takes to send a message between two nodes as this time will depend
          also on the distribution of nodes on the underlying physical
          network.</p>
                           <p>118. The scalability issue has been addressed by a number of
          proposed P2P implementation techniques developed within academic
          research projects such as Chord [40], Pastry [41], and Tapestry
          [42]. However, scalability has been taken yet another step further
          by the DKS system developed at the Swedish Institute of Computer
          Science (SICS. In DKS, the amount of administrative traffic required
          to keep track of nodes in the overlay network is significantly
          reduced, and dimensioning parameters of the system can be fine-tuned
          in a very general framework (that actually treats the other
          mentioned techniques as special cases) so as to improve the
          practical scalability.</p>
                           <p>119. Another important aspect of P2P systems is also the guarantees
          that can be given that any named object stored in the systems also
          can found. Such guarantees have improved over the P2P technology
          generations, and 100% guarantees can now be given by the DKS system
          assuming that there are no errors such as physical communication
          failures that make nodes unreachable. As intermittent or lasting
          communication failures must be expected in any practical system,
          techniques for improving the fault tolerance by means of replication
          of data have been investigated and are now being included into the
          general frameworks of P2P technologies.</p>
                           <p>120. However, practical applications of new P2P technologies like
          DKS in distributed systems need to be investigated in order to
          determine how well scalability and robustness functions in practise
          given the impact of underlying infrastructure and application
          properties. An example of an ongoing such project investigates the
          properties of a DKS based implementation of central service in the
          OpenSIS standard [49].</p>
                           <p>121. To summarise, P2P technologies have matured into a practical
          way of organising distributed systems in a decentralised way that is
          both highly scalable and reliable. Excellent reviews and
          descriptions of P2P technologies can be found in [16], [19], and
          [20].</p>

        needs to be a real time multi function system that interfaces to the
        back office systems for billing and to the network infrastructure
        systems. From an information engineering perspective there could be
        20-100 information items associated with a user, their devices and
        their content and if there are 10 million users on the system, it

          traditional directories for the last 20 years and they will be with
          us in the future. However, with the larger scale, converged services
          and event driven (presence) systems now being developed world wide
          (e.g. 3G-IMS), information, identity and presence services
          engineering and the technologies that support it will require some
          evolution. This could take the form of CADS (Composite Adaptive
          Directory Services) and CADS supported Service Delivery Platforms.
          CADS is an advanced directory service and contains functions for
          managing identity, presence, content and adaptation algorithms for
          self tuning and with its unique functions, greatly simplifies and
          enhances the design of converged services SDPs. See Service Delivery

          themselves as web based Application Programming Interfaces (API)
          that use XML messages to communicate. No one standard defines Web
          Services, but is comprised of four core standards:</p>

              services. A BPEL process can be used either to describe an
              executable work flow in a node (orchestration), or to describe
              the protocol for interaction between participants in a business
              process (choreography). <span class="bold">

                                 <p>137. Jini network technology [29] [30] is an open architecture
              that enables developers to create network-centric services that
              are highly adaptive to change. An architecture based on the idea
              of a federation rather than central control, Jini technology can
              be used to build adaptive networks that are scalable, evolvable
              and flexible as typically required in dynamic computing
              environments. Jini technology provides a flexible infrastructure
              for delivering services in a network and for creating
              spontaneous interactions between clients that use these services
              regardless of their hardware or software implementations.</p>
                                 <p>138. The Jini architecture specifies a discovery mechanism used
              by clients and services to find each other on the network and to
              work together to get a task accomplished. Service providers
              supply clients with portable Java technology based objects that
              implements the service and gives the client access to the
              service. The actual network interaction used can be of any type
              such as Java [39], CORBA [38], or [54], because the object
              encapsulates (hides) the communication so that the client only
              sees the Java object provided by the service.</p>
                                 <p>139. The Rio Project [31] extends the Jini technology [29] [30]
              to provide dynamic adaptive network architecture and uses a
              nomadic SOA approach. In a nomadic SOA services can migrate and
              self optimise their architectural structure to respond to the
              changing service environment.</p>
                                 <p>140. A fundamental tenet of distributed systems is they must be
              crafted with the reality that changes occur on the network.
              Compute resources have assets diminished or fail and new ones
              are introduced into the network. Applications executing on
              compute resources may fail, or suffer performance degradation
              based on diminishing compute resource capabilities and/or
              assets. Technology used must provide distributed,
              self-organizing, network-centric capabilities. Enables a
              dynamic, distributed architecture capable of adapting to
              unforeseen changes on the network.</p>

            forward looking WS-I is enhancing the current Basic Profile and
            providing guidance for interoperable asynchronous and reliable
            messaging. WS-I's profiles will be critical for making Web
            services interoperability a practical reality.</p>
                              <p>145. The first charter, a revision to the existing WS-I Basic
            Profile Working Group charter, resulted in the development of the
            Basic Profile 1.2 and the future development of the Basic Profile
            2.0. The Basic Profile 1.2 will incorporate asynchronous messaging
            and will also consider SOAP 1.1 with Message Transmission
            Optimisation Mechanism (MTOM) and XML-binary optimised Packaging
            (XOP). The Basic Profile 2.0 will build on the Basic Profile 1.2
            and will be based on SOAP 1.2 with MTOM and XOP. The second
            charter establishes a new working group, the Reliable Secure
            Profile Working Group, which will deliver guidance to Web services
            architects and developers concerning reliable messaging with
            security.</p>

              the Java Platform. It is used mainly for developing and running
              distributed multi-tier Java applications, based largely on
              modular software components running on a platform (application
              server). The platform provides the application with support for
              handling of transactions, security, scalability, concurrency and
              management of deployed applications. Applications are easily
              ported between different Java EE application servers.
              Applications developed for the Java EE can easily support Web
              Services. Java EE is often compared to Microsoft .Net [36], a
              comparison that is beyond the scope of this document. But it
              shall be noted that .Net is a product and framework closely
              related to development for the Windows operating system whereas
              Java EE is a specification that is followed by many product
              vendors.</p>

                                 <p>149. Microsoft .NET framework [36] is a Microsoft product
              closely related to application development for the Windows
              platform [36]. The framework includes the closely related C#
              programming language (even if it is a formal ISO standard) and
              the Common Language Runtime (CLR), which simplified is
              Microsoft's response to JAVA. Programs written for the NET.

              development of web service applications.</p>

                           <p>150. The Semantic Web initiative will make searches more accurate
          and enable increasingly sophisticated information services like
          intelligent agents that can find products and services, schedule
          appointments and make purchases. The initiative includes a sort of
          grammar and vocabulary that provide information about a document's
          components; this information will enable Web software to act on the
          meaning of Web content. Semantic Web software and Web services
          promise to shift the nature of the Web from a publishing and
          communications medium to an information management
          environment.</p>
                           <p>151. Semantic Web software includes a special set of Extensible
          Mark-up Language (XML) tags that includes Uniform Resource
          Identifiers (URL), a Resource Description Framework (RDF), and a Web
          Ontology Language (OWL).</p>
                           <p>152. Semantic Web software makes it possible for an intelligent
          agent to carry out the request "show me the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
          (UAV) operating in the current area of responsibility" even if there
          is no explicit list, because it knows that "area of responsibility"
          has the property "location" with the value "Kandahar", and in
          searching a directory of UAVs it knows to skip UAVs belonging to the
          United States, whose location value is "Kabul", but include German
          UAVs, whose location value is "Kandahar".</p>
                           <p>153. Semantic Web software organises Web information so that search
          engines and intelligent agents can understand properties and
          relationships. A university, for example, could be defined as an
          institution of higher education, which is a class of objects that
          has a set of properties like a population of students.</p>
                           <p>154. The World Wide Web Consortium released standards in February
          2004 that define the two foundation elements of the Semantic Web
          initiative: the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which provides
          a structure for interpreting information, and the Web Ontology
          Language (OWL), which provides a means for defining the properties
          and relationships of objects in Web information.</p>
                           <p>155. Web services provide a way for software to communicate with
          each other over the Web, enabling a form of distributed computing in
          which simple services can be combined to carry out complicated tasks
          like financial transactions.</p>
                           <p>156. Our most fundamental sensors are our senses themselves. They
          are quite sophisticated, the product of a complex evolutionary
          design. And yet we've improved on them as time has passed:
          telescopes and microscopes extend our eyes, thermometers extend our
          touch, and satellite dishes extend our ears. In addition, virtual
          sensors have been used for many years to monitor our computing
          environments. Smaller and more powerful computer processors allow
          sensors to be small and inexpensive enough that they can be
          everywhere. And with the advent of trillions and trillions of IPv6
          addresses, they can all be networked.</p>
                           <p>157. Networks, human or technological, are designed to communicate
          information from one point to others. But the value of a network is
          entirely dependent on the information it contains. And so the
          sensors that feed information into a network play a crucial role in
          maximising a network's value. Simply put, the better the sensors and
          the better the information they provide, the more valuable the
          network becomes.</p>
                           <p>158. Advanced sensors that report directly about their physical
          environment will enable truly revolutionary applications. Already
          there are sensors that can detect, measure, and transmit any
          physical quality such as temperature, pressure, colour, shape,
          sound, motion, and chemical composition. And, as sensors are
          becoming more sophisticated, they are also shrinking in size. Some
          are so tiny that they are difficult to detect.</p>
                           <p>159. Emerging sensor network technologies will be autonomous,
          intelligent, and mobile. These sensors will reconfigure themselves
          to achieve certain tasks. These requirements will provide rigid
          requirements for the computing, and delivery systems of the future.
          The networks and computing systems must reorganise themselves to
          serve the distributed agents with needs to communicate and exchange
          decisions, actions, and knowledge to other agents in secured
          environment.</p>

                           <p>160. Service component architecture (SCA) [73] is a technology
          development initiative driven by a group of middle-ware vendors. SCA
          extends and complements existing standards for service
          implementation and for web services; the goal is to simplify
          application development and implementation of SOA.</p>
                           <p>161. SCA components operate at a business level and are decoupled
          from the actual implementation technology and infrastructure used.
          SCA uses Service Data Objects (SDO) [74] to represent the business
          data that forms parameters and return value between the services.
          SCA thus provides uniform Service access and uniform Service data
          representation.</p>
