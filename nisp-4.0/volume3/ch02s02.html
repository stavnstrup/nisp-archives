                        <p>11. Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) are comprised of
        technologies that will provide network services when no end-to-end
        path exists through the network because of periodic or intermittent
        disruptions. Disruption may occur because of the limits of wireless
        radio range, sparsity of mobile nodes, energy resources, enemy attack,
        and noise. Such a robust communications network would have to be
        autonomic, secure and opportunistic.</p>

                              <strong>Implications</strong>
                           </span>: The research in
        this area is principally aimed at providing internet-like services and
        supporting "long-haul" reliable transmission in interplanetary space,
        but it has applications in other environments as well. The work done
        to overcome delays caused by interplanetary distances can easily be
        appealed to tactical military networks. Distance delays are just a
        subset of the more general group of Disruption sources.</p>

                           <p>13. Research goals in this area are to provide disruption
          tolerance by organizing information flow into bundles. These bundles
          are to be routed through an "intelligent" network that can manage
          the delivery of the bundles to the maximal extent permitted by the
          available topology. This method will allow messages to pass through
          the network with successive responsibilities, rather than the
          traditional end-to-end scheme. The mechanism of bundling will allow
          a network node to hold data if the next hop in the network is
          unavailable.</p>

                              </span>: The Internet
          Engineering Task Force (IETF) has recently published RFC 4838 and
          RFC 5050 to provide the common defining framework for the formation
          and transport of bundles of data. In 2008, the Bundle Protocol was
          successfully tested in space on the UK-DMC Disaster Monitoring
          Constellation satellite.</p>

                           <p>15. The Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) was designed to
          provide retransmission-based reliability over links characterized by
          extremely long message round-trip times (RTTs) and/or frequent
          interruptions in connectivity.</p>
                           <p>16. The Licklider Transmission Protocol (LTP) would replace both
          IP and TCP. Picturing protocols as layers in a stack, if the bottom
          layer is the physical wire line or radio wave connecting two
          devices, the Licklider Transmission Protocol sits just above that.
          It makes the link between two routers more reliable than IP and
          TCP.</p>

                           <p>19. A wireless personal area network (WPAN) is a computer network
          used for communication among computers, I/O peripherals (such as
          keyboards, printers, scanners, etc) and devices (such as wireless
          access points, cell phones and personal digital assistants) within
          reach of a person. The devices may or may not belong to the person
          in question. The range of a WPAN is typically less than 10 metres,
          and up to 1 kilometre under ideal conditions. WPANs can be used to
          replace cables between computers and their peripherals, to establish
          communities, or to establish location aware services. WPANs can be
          used for communication among the personal devices themselves
          (intra-personal communication), or for connecting to a higher level
          network and the Internet (an up link).</p>

          WPAN technology is known as plugging in. Ideally, when any two
          WPAN-equipped devices come into close proximity (within several
          metres of each other) or within a few kilometres of a central
          server, they can communicate as if connected by a cable. Another
          important feature is the ability of each device to lock out other
          devices selectively, preventing needless interference or
          unauthorised access to information.</p>

                              <p>23. Bluetooth technology already plays a part in the rising
            Voice over IP (VoIP) scene, with Bluetooth headsets being used as
            wireless extensions to the PC audio system. As VoIP becomes more
            popular, and more suitable for general home or office users than
            wired phone lines, Bluetooth may be used in Cordless handsets,
            with a base station connected to the Internet link.</p>
                              <p>24. The version of Bluetooth after , code-named , has many of
            the same features, but is most notable for plans to adopt
            Ultra-wideband radio technology. This will allow Bluetooth use
            over UWB radio, enabling very fast data transfers,
            synchronisations and file pushes, while building on the very low
            power idle modes of Bluetooth. The combination of a radio using
            little power when no data is transmitted, and a high data rate
            radio used to transmit bulk data, could be the start of software
            radios. Bluetooth, given its worldwide regulatory approval, low
            power operation, and robust data transmission capabilities,
            provides an excellent signalling channel to enable the soft radio
            concept.</p>

                                 </span>: On 28 March 2006,
            the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) announced its selection
            of the WiMedia Alliance Multi-Band Orthogonal Frequency Division
            Multiplexing (MB-OFDM) version of Ultra-wideband (UWB) for
            integration with current Bluetooth wireless technology. UWB
            integration will create a version of the globally popular
            Bluetooth wireless technology with a high speed/high data rate
            option. This new version of Bluetooth technology will meet the
            high-speed demands of synchronising and transferring large amounts
            of data as well as enabling high quality video and audio
            applications for portable devices, multi-media projectors and
            television sets, wireless VoIP. At the same time, Bluetooth
            technology will continue catering to the needs of very low power
            applications such as mice, keyboards and mono headsets, enabling
            devices to select the most appropriate physical radio for the
            application requirements, thereby offering the best of both
            worlds.</p>

                           <p>26. A wireless local area network (WLAN) is the linking of two or
          more computers without using wires. WLAN utilises spread-spectrum
          technology based on radio waves to enable communication between
          devices in a limited area, also known as the basic service set. This
          gives users the mobility to move around within a broad coverage area
          and still be connected to the network.</p>

                              <p>29. Many are familiar with 802.11, also known as WiFi, as a
            short-range wireless networking protocol for home and office
            connections. 802.11 represent a family of wireless standards. The
            802.11 series has been developed by the IEEE over the past 10
            years as part of the range of communications protocols under the
            802 standards series.</p>
                              <p>30. Each family member is identified by a letter suffix to the
            series name. Currently these letters run from "a" to "w", although
            there is the original base 802.11 wireless standard as well. Note
            that there is no L standard. Some family members represent
            amendments (a, b, g, i) to the original standard, whereas some
            represents enhancements or extensions (c-f, h-j, n).</p>
                              <p>31. The 802.11 family of protocols share two common frequency
            bands, 2.4GHz and 5GHz, the so-called Industrial, Scientific and
            Medical (ISM) bands. Further more, each of these bands are divided

            nation, constrained in part by how each nation allocates radio
            spectrum to various services. At one extreme, Japan permits the
            use of all 14 channels (with the exclusion of 802.11g/n from
            channel 14), while at the other Spain allowed only channels 10 and
            11 (later all of the 14 channels have been allowed ), to which
            France adds 12 and 13. Most other European countries are almost as
            liberal as Japan, disallowing only channel 14, while North America
            and some Central and South American countries further disallow 12
            and 13. The emerging standards within the 802.11 family are as

            improve the way traffic is distributed within a network by
            discovering the best available access point. In a wireless , each
            device normally connects to the access point (AP) that provides
            the strongest signal. Depending on the number and geographic
            locations of the subscribers, this arrangement can sometimes lead
            to excessive demand on one AP and underutilisation of others,
            resulting in degradation of overall network performance. In a
            network conforming to 802.11k, if the AP having the strongest
            signal is loaded to its full capacity, a wireless device is
            connected to one of the underutilised APs. Even though the signal
            may be weaker, the overall throughput is greater because more
            efficient use is made of the network resources. 802.11k and
            802.11r are the key industry standards now in development that
            will enable seamless Basic Service Set (BSS) transitions in the

                           <p>41. While many military installations have some sort of high-speed
          network backbone connected by fibre optic cabling, many of the
          buildings do not have high-speed connections to the backbone. This
          is because fibre-optic cabling, necessary for most high-speed
          communications, must first be installed in the ground.</p>
                           <p>42. Three emerging mobile data architectures have the most promise
          to eliminate the need for cables. In an effort to further improve
          mobile technology bandwidth, the IEEE 802 standards group which is
          already developing 802.11 (Wireless , WLAN), 802.15 (Personal Area
          Networks, PAN), 802.17 (Fixed Broadband Wireless Access, FBWA) has
          turned its attention to a new standardisation efforts on mobile
          broadband wireless access (MBWA).</p>
                           <p>43. As with many civil based technologies the key question is
          likely to be the performance of the system under stress (e.g.
          Interference/jamming). However, there exists a possibility of a low
          cost wireless network offering all IP connectivity for easy
          integration with other component networks, rapid base-station
          deployment, basic network security (allowing higher security to
          layer on top) and high performance to many users.</p>

                                 <strong>Importance</strong>
                              </span>: Installing fibres
          is a disruptive, costly and time-consuming process. Trenching costs
          become prohibitive to reach remote areas, such as transportation
          depots and ranges. Also, right-of-way issues and physical barriers
          such as lakes and historical grounds can increase the cost of
          installing fibre-optic cabling.</p>

                              <p>46. Although the new 3G systems (mobile phone companies have
            invested heavily in this technology) have just been launched not
            long ago, many companies have already started on researching and
            developing on the fourth generation (4G) system. Researchers are
            hoping that the 4G system can reach a much faster speed, a
            connection speed over 100Mb per second during connection, tighter
            network security and also bring up the quality during
            communication no matter on voice or video calls. Via mobile
            phones, many things such as the security system, surveillance on
            certain items could be done easily.</p>
                              <p>47. One 4G+ standardisation effort called Ultra Mobile Broadband
            (UMB) is being coordinated by 3GPP2 (Collaboration between five
            Asian and North American standards bodies. It will improve the
            CDMA2000 mobile phone standard for next generation applications
            and requirements. The proposed system intends to employ OFDMA
            technology along with advanced antenna techniques to provide peak
            rates of up to 280 Mbit/s. Goals for UMB include significantly
            improving system capacity, greatly increasing user data rates
            throughout the cell, lowering costs, enhancing existing services,
            making possible new applications, and making use of new spectrum
            opportunities. The technology will provide users with concurrent
            IP-based services in a full mobility environment.</p>

            data-connectivity for fixed, portable and mobile computing devices
            and appliances. The protocol is designed to be implemented with

                              <p>52. A mobile ad-hoc network (MANET) is a self-configuring
            network of mobile routers (and associated hosts) connected by
            wireless links. The routers are free to move randomly and
            arbitrarily organise themselves. Accordingly, the topology of the
            wireless network may change rapidly and unpredictably. Such a
            network may operate in a standalone fashion, or may be connected
            to the larger Internet. With attributes such as minimal
            configuration and quick deployment make ad hoc networks
            appropriate for situations like disasters (natural or man-made),
            medical emergencies, military conflicts, etc.</p>
                              <p>53. The earliest predate the Internet and were called "packet
            radio" networks. These early packet radio systems were part of the
            motivation of the original Internet Protocol suite. Current are
            designed principally for military utility; examples include Joint
            Tactical Radio System (JTRS) and the High-Capacity Data Radio
            (HCDR).</p>
                              <p>54. The widespread IEEE 802.11 ("WiFi") wireless protocol
            incorporates an ad-hoc networking system when no wireless access
            points are present, although it would be considered a very
            low-grade ad-hoc protocol by specialists in the field. The IEEE
            802.11 system only handles traffic within a local "cloud" of
            wireless devices. Each node transmits and receives data, but does
            not route anything between the network's systems. However,
            higher-level protocols can be used to aggregate various IEEE
            802.11 ad-hoc networks into .</p>

                              <p>55. A sensor network is composed of a large number of sensor
            nodes that are densely deployed either inside an area of operation
            or very close to it. The sensor nodes are tiny, low-cost,
            low-power, self-organising and multi-functional (sensing, data
            processing, and communicating). Since the sensor nodes can be
            random deployed, such networks are ideal in inaccessible terrains
            or disaster relief operations</p>

            signals into packets that transmited over an IP network. This
            capability of integrating disparate data and video signals with an
            IP infrasturcture could be the long disatnce hauler of short
            distance radio signals. With RoIP, there are no interoperability
            issues, all radio signals (e.g. VHF, UHF, POTS telephone, cellular
            telephone, SATCOM, air-to-ground) are packetized the same.
            Demodulation and detection of the orignal message is done after it

                              <p>59. Radio Frequency Identification technology shares some
            similar characteristics with IP technology. IP is a remarkably
            flexible addressing system for information while RFID is a
            flexible addressing system for physical objects. RFID creates "an
            Internet of things" - a world of objects connected by Internet
            technologies. Indeed, it is possible that this new Internet of
            objects could significantly affect network architecture in the
            years to come.</p>
                              <p>60. RFID is the labelling system behind IP-enabled inventory and
            supply. Standard RFID tags contain three times the amount of
            information that can be stored in bar codes. They transmit data
            without contact or Line-of-sight with the reader, and can be read
            through dust, snow, ice, paint, or grime - conditions that render
            optical technologies, like bar coding, useless. Long-range tags
            can be read at speeds achievable by cars or trains, automated toll
            readers are a good example of this.</p>
                              <p>61. Capacitor / Coil (1) RFID reader Broadcasts electromagnetic
            signal to tag (4). The tag's coils release an encoded radio wave
            containing the information in the tag, which the reader then
            demodulates.(2) Antenna in the tag receives the signal from the
            reader and stores charge in a capacitor.(3) When the capacitor has
            built up enough energy, it releases it over time to the tag's
            coils.</p>

                              <p>62. Most RFID tags are passive and read-only. With a virtually
            unlimited operating lifetime, they consist of little more than a
            computer chip and an antenna. A compatible reader provides power
            to the tag over short distances between a few centimetres to
            thirty meters. The tag 'awakens' and reports any information it
            has available to the reader. Active tags, on the other hand, are
            self-powered, have longer ranges than passive tags, and are
            constantly reporting relevant information to any reader within
            range. Active tags are becoming increasingly common, especially on
            expensive items, or cartons of items. A reader installed in a
            lock, for example, can automatically receive information from
            active tags in every vessel and shipping box that passes through.
            Additionally, some RFID tags are writable as well as
            readable.</p>
                              <p>63. Security is the key challenge with RFID. If a NATO nation
            implements RFID in its supply chain, and does not want other NATO
            nations to track its shipments and inventory, then that nation
            would perceive RFID technology as a significant security
            vulnerability.</p>
                              <p>64. Some researchers have proposed schemes that would require
            tags to authenticate readers, transmitting information only to
            authorised readers. The tags would have to store ID numbers for
            authorised readers, and a reader would have to broadcast its ID to
            the tag. To protect the reader's ID and prevent others from
            eavesdropping and stealing the information, the reader uses either
            a fixed or randomly generated number to hash (encrypt) its ID. If
            the tag cannot authenticate the reader's identity, the tag will
            refuse to transmit the information it stores. Like most security
            tactics, this scheme is vulnerable to attacks, such as man in the
            middle, or reverse engineering.</p>

            existing back-end infrastructures. middle-ware, for example, can
            help with the current lack of standards in RFID. If an
            organisation picks a standard that changes or loses its market
            prevalence, middle-ware can transform the data from readers into
            the format supported by back-end systems.</p>

                              <p>72. Cognitive Radio technology is, when combined with Software
            Defined Radio technology, an effort to efficiently utilise the
            electromagnetic spectrum. The argument is that in any given region
            of the world, some portions of the spectrum are over utilised
            while some are underutilised. A cognitive radio will analyse the
            local spectrum and determine where there are spectrum "holes", or
            under-used spectrum. It is in these "holes" that the adaptive
            radio will operate by using software defined radio technology to
            reconfigure its broadcasting characteristics as needed.</p>
                              <p>73. The real issue is how that spectrum is managed, not the lack
            of available spectrum. A cognitive radio will not only analyse the
            spectrum usage, but negotiate usage with nearby devices. Compare
            the scheme to a driver's reacting to what she sees other drivers
            doing. If you are in a traffic lane that is heavy, maybe it's time
            for you to shift to another lane that is not so busy. When
            shifting lanes, however, a driver needs to follow rules that
            prevent her from bumping into others.</p>
                              <p>74. The MAC layer of the IEEE 802.22 wireless standard will be
            based in Cognitive Radio Technology. It needs to be also able to
            adapt dynamically to changes in the environment by sensing the
            spectrum. The MAC layer will consist of two structures: Frame and
            Superframe. A superframe will be formed by many frames. The
            superframe will have an SCH (Superframe Control Header) and a
            preamble. These will be sent by the BS in every channel that it's
            possible to transmit and not cause interference. When a CPE is
            turned on, it will sense the spectrum, find out which channels are
            available and will receive all the needed information to attach to
            the BS. Two different types of spectrum measurement will be done
            by the CPE: in-band and out-of-band. The in-band measurement
            consists in sensing the actual channel that is being used by the
            BS and CPE. The out-of-band measurement will consist in sensing
            the rest of the channels. The MAC layer will perform two different
            types of sensing in either in-band or out-of-band measurements:
            fast sensing and fine sensing. Fast sensing will consist in
            sensing at speeds of under 1ms per channel. This sensing is
            performed by the CPE and the BS and the BS's will gather all the
            information and will decide if there is something new to be done.
            The fine sensing takes more time (approximately 25 ms per channel
            or more) and it is utilized based on the outcome of the previous
            fast sensing mechanism. These sensing mechanisms are primarily
            used to identify if there is an incumbent transmitting, and if
            there is a need to avoid interfering with it.</p>

                           <p>80. Fibre-Channel over ethernet allows Fibre-Channel devices to
          connect with one another over ethernet based networks. With FCoE,
          native Fibre-Channel frames are encapsulated into ethernet frames to
          be sent over a 10-Gbit Ethernet network. Considered a low-cost, high
          performance alternative to Fibre-Channel over long distances. The
          main applications that benifet from this technology are sStorage
          Area Networks (SANs). With FCoE, network (IP) and storage (SAN) data

          the Internet Protocol (IP), and is defined in the RFC 2960 (IETF
          standard). SCTP was developed to provide reliable transport of SS7
          messages over an IP network.</p>
                           <p>83. The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a new IP
          transport protocol that operates on top of the Internet Protocol
          (IP), and is defined in the RFC 2960 (IETF standard). It exists at
          an equivalent level with UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP
          (Transmission Control Protocol), which provide transport layer
          functions to many Internet applications.</p>
                           <p>84. Like TCP, SCTP provides a reliable transport service, ensuring
          that data is transported across the network without error and in
          sequence. Like TCP, SCTP is a session-oriented mechanism, meaning
          that a relationship is created between the endpoints of an SCTP
          association prior to data being transmitted, and this relationship
          is maintained until all data transmission has been successfully
          completed.</p>
                           <p>85. Unlike TCP, SCTP provides a number of functions that are
          critical for telephony signalling transport, and at the same time
          can potentially benefit other applications needing transport with
          additional performance and reliability.</p>
