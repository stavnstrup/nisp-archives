                     <p>520. This guideline document describes a concept and model for how
    knowledge of proven solutions in the form of design rules can be
    documented and packaged in order to form a shared basis for the future
    development of NNEC based systems for NATO.</p>
                     <p>521. The processes in which design rules are identified, produced and
    used are not described within this guideline.</p>

                        <p>522. In the development of large systems of systems or federated
      systems for the future needs of the NATO there are several problems to
      be solved as well as opportunities to exploit. The problems range from
      what methods to use for requirements capture and design to how to solve
      detailed technical matters.</p>
                        <p>523. In order to be able to establish a set of building blocks that can
      be used to meet the needs of the future NNEC, design regulations are
      absolutely essential if the building blocks shall be possible to be used
      together and combined in different ways, from a technical as well as
      from a business point of view.</p>
                        <p>524. Design regulations in this context are the descriptive or
      normative regulation work necessary for NATO nations to be able to
      implement, configure and use systems in a federated environment. This
      includes not only technical and business design, but also the ability to
      manage and maintain these regulations to be able to provide the NATO
      nations with flexible component based systems.</p>
                        <p>525. Moreover, there is a strong incentive to endorse reuse of proven
      solutions or implementations and thus get a more cost-effective
      solution. The overall quality is also expected to benefit from this kind
      of reuse.</p>
                        <p>526. In this document we will focus on the model for design rules, and
      the patterns for setting up the SIOP and SIP:s between federations, this
      in order to be able to exchange information services between
      parties.</p>
                        <p>527. Design rules patterns and knowledge for supporting NATO Nations in
      designing NNEC compliant components and services can also be retrieved
      from different Nations repositories as reference architectures, Sweden
      Design rules (releasable to NATO) will be included as one of the Partner
      nations reference architecture as recommended and proven patterns in
      order to achieve NNEC interoperability.</p>

                           <p>528. Design rules are about reusing knowledge of proven solutions. In
        the context of NNEC we are especially interested in reuse of solutions
        that provide typical NNEC characteristics. In addition to this, the
        use of design rules aim at making the development of NNEC more
        cost-effective and improve the quality in the resulting
        products.</p>
                           <p>529. As mentioned before, a design rule is in the most general
        description a three-part rule, which expresses a relation between a
        certain context, a problem or an opportunity and a solution.</p>
                           <p>530. Different design rules may be in conflict with each other, e.g.
        in that the solution of one design rule can be incompatible with the
        solution of the other.</p>
                           <p>531. Moreover, design rules can be singular or aggregates meaning
        that it either is an atomic rule or an aggregate of rules that
        together constitute the rule. The aggregate may include rules on how
        to combine the possibly conflicting aggregated rules in order to
        generate a rule according to the current priorities.</p>
                           <p>532. Design rules may be implemented for solutions on different
        levels. There may be design rules for specific technical design
        problems or rules, how to handle a major business opportunities. It is
        however anticipated that the majority of design rules valid for an
        NNEC-system will be focused on the higher levels.</p>
                           <p>533. Design rules can be used in order to meet functional as well as
        non-functional needs of the system of interest. It should be clear
        from all design rules which problem or opportunity it is supposed to
        solve.</p>

                           <p>535. At least one of the mentioned prerequisites should be fulfilled.
        There may of course be other valid prerequisites, which will be
        assessed and used to initiate the design of a design rule.</p>
                           <p>536. Design rules shall consist of either atomic rules or aggregates
        of rules that together shall constitute the rule. The aggregate may
        include rules on how to combine the possibly conflicting rules in
        order to generate a rule according to the priorities.</p>
                           <p>537. An atomic design rule must not contain solutions for more than
        one subject area, e.g. mixing of business and technical subjects shall
        be avoided. Detailed technical rules shall in the same way be
        separated from rules of information or logical nature.</p>
                           <p>538. Design rules shall where applicable be based on concepts and
        rules in an extended NATO Architecture Framework.</p>
                           <p>539. A design rule shall not be of too low granularity or too trivial
        in order to avoid an explosion in the number produced of design rules.
        To achieve the approved mandatory validity, a design rule shall
        specify the way to solve the problem it is intended for. Rules that
        can be expressed in single sentences are collected in general sections
        in the design rule solution part.</p>
                           <p>540. Great efforts shall be made to ensure that the design rule is
        maintainable. This is primarily achieved by limiting the problem area
        that the design rule is intended for. More complex problems or
        opportunities shall be supported by aggregates of rules.</p>

        one, DRP.</p>

      implemented, it is important to understand how they impact the other
      frameworks and processes used in design. These frameworks and processes
      also have to be adjusted so it becomes clear as to what is documented
      where and when.</p>

        how and together with what, does not always mean that complex system
