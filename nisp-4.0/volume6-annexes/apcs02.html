                        <p>210. Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a paradigm for organizing
        and using distributed capabilities that may be under the control of
        different ownership domains. It is natural in such a context to think
        of one person&#8217;s needs being met by capabilities offered by someone
        else or, in the world of distributed computing, one computer agent&#8217;s
        requirements being met by a computer agent belonging to a different
        owner. There is not necessarily a one-to-one correlation between needs
        and capabilities; the granularity of needs and capabilities vary from
        fundamental to complex, and any given need may require the combining
        of numerous capabilities while any single capability may address more
        than one need. The perceived value of SOA is that it provides a
        powerful framework for matching needs and capabilities and for
        combining capabilities to address those needs.</p>
                        <p>211. Visibility, interaction, and effect are key concepts for
        describing the SOA paradigm. <span class="bold">
                              <strong>Visibility</strong>
                           </span> refers to the capacity for those
        with needs and those with capabilities to be able to see each other to
        interact. Visibility is typically enhanced through the use of metadata
        to describe such aspects as functional and technical requirements,
        related constraints and policies, and mechanisms for interaction. For
        maximum visibility, metadata must be in a form in which its syntax and
        semantics are widely accessible and understandable.</p>
                        <p>212. Whereas visibility introduces the possibilities for matching
        needs to capabilities (and vice versa), <span class="bold">
                              <strong>interaction </strong>
                           </span> is the activity of using the
        capability. Typically mediated by the exchange of messages, an
        interaction proceeds through a series of information exchanges and
        invoked actions. There are many facets of interaction; but they are
        all grounded in a particular <span class="bold">
                              <strong>execution context
        </strong>
                           </span> &#8211; the set of technical and business elements that together
        form a path between those with needs and those with capabilities and
        that permit information to be exchanged, actions to be performed and
        provides a decision point for any policies and contracts that may be
        in force.</p>
                        <p>213. The purpose of using a capability is to realize one or more
        <span class="bold">
                              <strong>real world effects</strong>
                           </span>. At its core, an
        interaction is &#8220;an act&#8221; rather than &#8220;an object&#8221; and the result of a
        interaction is an effect (or a set/series of effects).</p>
                        <p>214. The expected effects, together with relevant preconditions
        associated with those effects, should be made visible as part of the
        capability metadata and form an important part of the assessment as to
        whether a given capability matches similarly described needs. It is
        not possible to describe every possible effect of using a capability:
        indeed a cornerstone of SOA is that such knowledge is not
        necessary.</p>
                        <p>215. A concept that is considered central to SOA has not yet been
        mentioned &#8211; that of <span class="bold">
                              <strong>service</strong>
                           </span>. Both
        needs and capabilities exist outside of SOA. What distinguishes SOA is
        the perceived improvement in bringing needs and capabilities together.
        <span class="bold">
                              <strong>In SOA, services are the mechanism by which
        needs and capabilities are brought together.</strong>
                           </span> SOA is not the
        solution of domain problems but rather a way of organizing a wider
        array of possibilities to generate a domain solution. By itself, SOA
        does not provide a solution to a difficult domain problem where a
        satisfactory solution does not already exist. SOA can, however,
        provide an organizing and delivery paradigm that enables one to get
        more value from use of both solutions which are locally &#8220;owned&#8221; and
        solutions under the control of others. It also enables one to express
        solutions in a way that makes it easier to modify or evolve the
        identified solution or to try alternate domain solutions.</p>
                        <p>216. The concepts of visibility, interaction, and effect apply
        directly to services in the same manner as these were described for
        the general SOA paradigm. Visibility is promoted by the <span class="bold">
                              <strong>service description</strong>
                           </span> which contains the
        information necessary to interact with the service and describes this
        in such terms as the service inputs, outputs, and associated
        semantics. The service description also conveys what is accomplished
        when the service is invoked and the conditions for invoking the
        service. In general, entities (people and organizations) offer
        capabilities through services and act as <span class="bold">
                              <strong>service
        providers</strong>
                           </span>. Those with needs who make use of capabilities
        through their associated services are referred to as <span class="bold">
                              <strong>service consumers</strong>
                           </span>. The service description
        allows prospective consumers to decide if the service is suitable for
        their current needs and establish whether a consumer satisfies the
        requirements, if any, of the service provider to be permitted
        access.</p>
                        <p>217. Having described what is SOA, it is appropriate to note several
        things which are related but are not necessary attributes or
        restrictions.</p>
                        <p>218. SOA identifies necessary aspects of interactions involving
        multiple ownership domains; however, it does not directly embody
        concepts relating to ownership.</p>
                        <p>219. SOA is commonly implemented using Web services, but services can
        be made visible, support interaction, and generate effects through
        other implementations.</p>
                        <p>220. By following a Service-Oriented Architecture NATO nations can
        then participate in an NNEC environment, by acting as interoperable
        nodes on a fixed or mobile ad hoc network. Once an element operates as
        a node, it can discover and register its needs and capabilities on a
        network, and use that network to communicate, interact and function
        with other nodes. The ultimate result is greater mission
        effectiveness.</p>
                        <p>221. In February of 2005, the Organization for the Advancement of
        Structured Information Standards (OASIS) started standards work to
        define an SOA reference model (SOA-RM) by establishing a technical
        committee for that sole purpose.</p>
                        <p>222. The goal of OASIS SOA-RM technical committee is to "establish a
        Reference Model to encourage the continued growth of specific and
        different SOA implementations whilst preserving a common layer that
        can be shared and understood between those or future
        implementations."</p>
                        <p>223. Achievement of their goals for this reference model will be done
        by defining the fundamental nature of SOA, and emerge with a common
        vocabulary and understanding of SOA. As such, it will provide a
        conforming reference that treats SOA as a powerful abstract model that
        is independent of the various inevitable technology evolutions.</p>

                        <p>224. The main drivers for SOA-based architectures are the requirement
        to facilitate the manageable growth of large-scale enterprise systems,
        the requirement to facilitate Internet-scale provisioning and use of
        services and the requirement to reduce costs in organization to
        organization cooperation.</p>
                        <p>225. The value of SOA is that it provides a simple scalable paradigm
        for organizing large networks of systems that require interoperability
        to realize the value inherent in the individual components. Indeed,
        SOA is scalable because it makes the fewest possible assumptions,
        including about the network and also minimizes any trust assumptions
        that are often implicitly made in smaller scale systems.</p>
                        <p>226. An architect using SOA principles is better equipped, therefore,
        to develop systems that are scalable, evolvable and manageable. It
        should be easier to decide how to integrate functionality across
        ownership boundaries. For example, a large company that acquires a
        smaller company must determine how to integrate the acquired IT
        infrastructure into its overall IT portfolio.</p>
                        <p>227. Through this inherent ability to scale and evolve, SOA enables
        an IT portfolio which is also adaptable to the needs of a specific
        problem domain or process architecture. The infrastructure SOA
        encourages is also more agile and responsive than one built on an
        exponential number of pair-wise interfaces. Therefore, SOA can also
        provide a solid foundation for business agility and
        adaptability.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>228. A key concept of SOA is that of <span class="bold">
                              <strong>service
        </strong>
                           </span>. In general, entities (people and organizations) create
        capabilities to solve or support a solution for the problems they face
        in the course of their business. SOA is a way to organize the world
        around this key concept of service. The noun &#8220;service&#8221; is defined in
        dictionaries as &#8220;The performance of work (a function) by one for
        another.&#8221; However, service, as the term is generally understood, also
        combines the following related ideas:</p>
                        <div class="itemizedlist">
                           <ul class="itemizedlist">
                              <li class="listitem">
                                 <p>The capability to perform work for another</p>
                              </li>
                              <li class="listitem">
                                 <p>The specification of the work offered for another</p>
                              </li>
                              <li class="listitem">
                                 <p>The offer to perform work for another</p>
                              </li>
                           </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p>229. These concepts emphasize a distinction between a capability and
        the ability to bring that capability to bear in the context of SOA,
        where the capability exists independently of SOA. The term service
        should, therefore, be understood as a set of separate, yet
        interrelated and more precise concepts. These concepts are an offer,
        interaction and effect.</p>
                        <p>230. The concept of an <span class="bold">
                              <strong>offer</strong>
                           </span> follows
        directly from the dictionary definition of service: 'by one' and 'for
        another.' In general terms, an offer is a proposal; made by providers
        which may possess a capability that address a need. In order to use a
        service, it is necessary to know that it exists, what is accomplished
        if the service is invoked, how the service is invoked, and other
        characteristics. Collectively this is the service <span class="bold">
                              <strong> visibility</strong>
                           </span>. When given an explicit searchable
        form, this information allows, for example, prospective consumers to
        decide if the service is suitable for their current needs and
        establish whether a consumer satisfies any requirements of the service
        provider to be permitted access. This information constitutes the
        <span class="bold">
                              <strong> service description</strong>
                           </span>.</p>
                        <p>231. The convergence of a capability and a need results in an
        <span class="bold">
                              <strong>interaction</strong>
                           </span>. In an SOA, interaction
        is effected by exchanging information between service providers and
        consumers. Typically this is achieved by exchanging messages using a
        standardized protocol; however, there are many modalities possible for
        interacting with services.</p>
                        <p>232. At its core, an interaction is &#8220;an act&#8221; rather than &#8220;an object.
        Therefore, interaction is the focus of the interfaces and behaviour
        necessary to support the interaction. Recall that interaction may, and
        typically does, involve crossing ownership boundaries. SOA identifies
        some of the necessary aspects of interactions involving multiple
        ownership domains; however, it does not directly embody concepts
        relating to ownership.</p>
                        <p>233. The final key concept is the <span class="bold">
                              <strong>real world
        effect</strong>
                           </span> of using services; it is always the case that there
        is an intended purpose to providing a service and similarly to using a
        service. Given that there is often an ownership boundary between the
        service provider and consumer, there is a natural distinction to be
        drawn between the public interactions with a service and the private
        actions of both the service provider and consumer. This distinction
        maintains and encourages independence of each service participant
        which, in turn, greatly enhances the scalability and security
        attributes of SOA. Focus can be directed to the public aspects of
        using a service by examining the <span class="bold">
                              <strong>conditions</strong>

                           </span> that arise as a result of using

                           <p>235. Note, the <span class="bold">
                                 <strong>service consumer</strong>

          (1) does not typically know how the information is generated, e.g.
          whether it is extracted from a database or generated dynamically; in
          (2), the service consumer does not typically know how the state
          change is effected. In either case, the service consumer would need
          to provide input parameters required by the service and the service
          would return information, status indicators, or error descriptions,
          where both the input and output are as described by the data model
          exposed through the published service interface. Note that the
          service may be invoked without requiring information from the
          consumer (other than a command to initiate action) and may
          accomplish its functions without providing any return or feedback to
          the consumer.</p>
                           <p>236. The service concept above emphasizes a distinction between a
          capability that represents some functionality created to address a
          need and the point of access to bring that capability to bear in the
          context of SOA. It is assumed that capabilities exist outside of the
          SOA. In actual use, maintaining this distinction may not be critical
          (i.e. the service may be talked about in terms of being the
          capability) but the separation is pertinent in terms of a clear
          expression of the nature of SOA and the value it provides.</p>

                           <p>237. The service description represents the information needed in
          order to use a service. It may be considered part of or the complete
          set of the metadata associated with a service.
          In any case, the service description overlaps and shares many common
          properties with service metadata. In most cases, there is no one
          &#8220;right&#8221; set of metadata but rather the metadata content depends on
          the context and the needs of the parties using the associated
          entity. The same holds for a service description. While there are
          certain elements that are likely to be part of any service
          description, most notably the data model, many elements such as
          function and policy may vary.</p>
                           <p>238. Best practice suggests that the service description should be
          represented using a standard, referenceable format. Such a format
          facilitates the use of common processing tools (such as discovery
          engines) that can, in turn, capitalize on the service
          description.</p>
                           <p>239. While the concept of a SOA supports use of a service without
          the service consumer needing to know the details of the service
          implementation, the service description makes available critical
          information that a consumer needs in order to decide whether or not
          to use a service. In particular, a service consumer must possess the
          following items of information:</p>

                              <p>241. A service description should include sufficient data to
            permit a service consumer and service provider to exchange
            information. This might include metadata (such as the location of
            the service and what information protocols it supports and
            requires) and information that allows the service consumer to
            determine if the service is currently reachable or not.</p>

            function(s) of the service and the real world effects that result from it being invoked. This portion of the
            description needs to be expressed in a way that is generally
            understandable by service consumers but able to accommodate a
            vocabulary that is sufficiently expressive for the domain for
            which the service provides its functionality. The description of
            functionality may include, among other possibilities, a textual
            description intended for human consumption or identifiers or
            keywords referenced to specific machine-processable definitions.
            For a full description, it may be useful to indicate multiple
            identifiers or keywords from a number of different collections of
            definitions.</p>
                              <p>243. Part of the description of functionality may include
            underlying technical assumptions that determine the limits of
            functionality exposed by the service or of the underlying
            capability.</p>

                              <p>244. Items 3 and 4 from Section 2.2.4.2 relate to the service
            description&#8217;s support for associating constraints and policies
            with a service and providing necessary information for prospective
            consumers to evaluate if a service will act in a manner consistent
            with the consumer&#8217;s constraints and policies.</p>
                              <p>245. In some situations the consumer may similarly provide an
            indication of its constraints and policies to support a service&#8217;
            need to do a similar evaluation of suitability. Thus, both
            prospective consumers and providers are likely to use the service

                              <p>246. The service interface is the means referred to in Item 5 for
            interacting with a service. It includes the specific protocols,
            commands, and information exchange by which actions are initiated
            that result in the real world effects as specified through the
            service functionality portion of the service description.</p>
                              <p>247. The specifics of the interface should be syntactically
            represented in a standard referenceable format. These prescribe
            what information needs to be provided to the service in order to
            exercise its functionality and/or the results of the service
            invocation to be returned to the service consumer. This logical
            expression of the set of information items associated with the
            consumption of the service is often referred to as the service
            data model. It should be noted that the particulars of the
            standard referenceable format is beyond the scope of the reference
            model. However, requiring that mechanisms be available (in order
            to define and retrieve such definitions) is fundamental to the SOA
            concept.</p>

                           <p>248. One of the hallmarks of a Service Oriented Architecture is the
          degree of documentation and description associated with it;
          particularly machine processable descriptions &#8211; otherwise known as
          metadata.</p>
                           <p>249. The purpose of this metadata is to facilitate integration,
          particularly across ownership domains. By providing public
          descriptions, it makes it possible for potential participants to
          construct applications that use services and even offer compatible
          services. Standardizing the formats of such metadata reduces the
          cost and burden of producing the descriptions necessary to promote
          reuse and integration.</p>

                              <p>250. An important additional benefit of metadata &#8211; as opposed to
            informal natural language descriptions &#8211; is its potential to
            facilitate automated software development. Both service providers
            and service consumers can benefit from such automation &#8211; reducing
            the cost of developing such systems.</p>
                              <p>251. For example, metadata can be used as a basis of discovery in
            dynamic systems. Metadata can assist in managing a service,
            validating and auditing usage of services which may also be
            simplified by rich metadata. It can also help ensure that
            requirements and expectations (regarding the content of any data
            interchanged) are properly interpreted and fulfilled.</p>

                              <p>252. There are well-known theoretic limits on the effectiveness
            of descriptions &#8211; it is simply not possible to specify, completely
            and unambiguously the precise semantics of a service. There will
            always be unstated assumptions made by the describer of a service
            that must be implicitly shared by readers of the description. This
            applies to machine processable descriptions as well as to human
            readable descriptions.</p>
                              <p>253. Fortunately, complete precision is not necessary either &#8211;
            what is required is sufficient precision to enable required
            functionality.</p>
                              <p>254. Another kind of limit of service descriptions is more
            straightforward: whenever a repository is searched using any kind
            of query there is always the potential for zero or more responses.
            There may be many reasons why a multiplicity of responses is
            returned: there might be several versions of the service, there
            might be competing services that offer overlapping functionality
            and there might be services from multiple different
            providers.</p>
                              <p>255. In the case that there is more than one response, this set
            of responses has to be converted into a choice of a single service
            in order for a service consumer to ensure the required function
            performed. In a multi-provider scenario, that choice must also
            take into account real world aspects of the service &#8211; such as
            whether the service consumer can identify the provider, can or
            should trust the provider, and whether the provider is reliable
            and timely in delivering the service offered. It is unlikely that
            all such factors can be easily and securely encoded in
            descriptions and search criteria.</p>

                        <p>256. Interacting with a service involves exchanging information with
        the service and performing actions against the service. In many cases,
        this is accomplished by sending and receiving messages, but there are
        other modes possible that do not involve explicit message
        transmission. However, for simplicity, we often refer to message
        exchange as the primary mode of interaction with a service. The forms
        of information exchanged and understood, together with the mechanisms
        used to exchange information, constitute the <span class="bold">

                           <p>258. The data model of a service is a characterization of the
          information associated with the use of the service.</p>
                           <p>259. The scope of the data model includes the format of exchanged
          information, the structural relationships within documents and the
          definition of terms used. Typically, only information about, and
          data potentially included in, an exchange with a service are
          generally considered as being part of that service's data
          model.</p>
                           <p>260. There are two important aspects of a data model that are
          important in interpreting information exchange &#8211; the structure of
          the information and the meaning assigned to elements of the
          information. Particularly for information that is exchanged across
          an ownership boundary, the interpretation of strings and other
          tokens in the information is a critical part of the semantics of the
          interaction.</p>

                              <p>261. Understanding the representation, structure and form of
            information exchanged is a key initial step in ensuring effective
            interactions with a service. There are several levels of such
            structural information; ranging from the encoding of character
            data, through the use of formats such as XML, SOAP and
            schema-based representations.</p>
                              <p>262. A described data model typically has a great deal to say
            about the form of messages, about the types of the various
            components of messages and so on. However, pure &#8220;typed&#8221;
            information is not sufficient to completely describe the

                              <p>263. The primary task of any communication infrastructure is to
            facilitate the exchange of information and the exchange of intent.
            For example, a purchase order combines two somewhat orthogonal
            aspects: the description of the items being purchased and the fact
            that one party intends to purchase those items from another party.
            Even if for exchanges that do not cross any ownership boundaries,
            exchanges with services have similar aspects: this is an update to
            the customer profile with these changes.</p>
                              <p>264. Especially in the case where the exchanges are across
            ownership boundaries, a critical issue is the interpretation of
            the data. This interpretation must be consistent between the
            participants in the service interaction. Consistent interpretation
            is a stronger requirement than merely type (or structural)
            consistency &#8211; the tokens in the data itself must also have a
            shared basis.</p>
                              <p>265. An ontology is a formal description of terms and the
            relationships between them in a given context. It will include
            information about how terms should be interpreted within a given
            context, constraints on and functions of valid values for the data
            and associated properties, as well as information about possible
            relationships of some terms to other terms (hierarchical,
            class/sub class, associative, dependent, etc.).</p>
                              <p>266. The role of explicit ontologies in an SOA is to provide a
            firm basis for selecting correct interpretations for elements of
            information exchanged.</p>
                              <p>267. Ontologies also provide a point of context to facilitate the
            reinterpretation of data. Such a reinterpretation is effectively
            represented as a particular traversal of the graph of concepts and
            relationships embodied in the ontology. How much automation of
            ontology walking is appropriate will depend on the nature of the
            service and the service participants.</p>
                              <p>268. Note that, for the most part, it is not expected that
            service consumers and providers would actually exchange ontologies
            in their interaction &#8211; the role of the ontology is a background
            one &#8211; it facilitates sound interactions. Hence ontology references
            are mostly to be found in <span class="bold">

                              <p>269. More specifically, and in order for a service to be
            consistent, the service should make consistent use of terms as
            defined in an ontology. Specific domain semantics are beyond the
            scope of this reference model; but there is a requirement that the
            service interface enable providers and consumers to identify
            unambiguously those definitions that are relevant to their
            respective domains.</p>

                           <p>270. The second key requirement for successful interactions with
          services is knowledge of the process or temporal aspects of
          interacting with the service. Loosely, this can be characterized as
          knowledge of the actions on, responses to and temporal dependencies
          between actions on the service.</p>
                           <p>271. For example, in a security-controlled access to a database
          service, the actions available to a service consumer might include
          presenting credentials, requesting database updates and reading
          results of queries. The security may be based on a
          challenge-response protocol. For example, the initiator presents an
          initial token of identity, the responder presents a challenge and
          the initiator responds to the challenge in a way that satisfies the
          service. Only after the user&#8217;s credentials have been verified will
          any action that queries and/or updates the database be accepted. The
          sequences of actions involved are a critical aspect of the knowledge
          required for successful use of the secured database service.</p>
                           <p>272. There are other aspects of the behaviour of services that are
          important. These include, for example, whether the service is
          transactional, idempotent or long running. As a particular example,
          a service that supports updating an account balance with a
          transaction is typically idempotent; i.e., the state of the account
          would not be affected should a subsequent interaction be attempted
          for the same transaction.</p>

            characterizes the temporal relationships between actions and
            events associated with interacting with the service. It is fairly
            common to partition the process model associated with a service
            into two levels: the particular sequences of operations needed to
            achieve single service exchanges and longer term transactions.
            These two levels may be nested &#8211; a long running transaction is

            some architectures the process model will include aspects that are

            service there are other, higher-order, attributes of services&#8217;
            process models that are also often important. These can include
            whether the service is <span class="bold">
                                    <strong>idempotent</strong>
                                 </span>, whether the service is

                                    <strong>long-running</strong>

            whether it is important to account for any <span class="bold">
                                    <strong>transactional</strong>
                                 </span> aspects of the
            service.</p>
                              <p>277. A service is <span class="bold">
                                    <strong>idempotent</strong>
                                 </span> if
            subsequent attempts to perform identical transactions are
            discounted. For example, it often important that a bank will only
            cash a check once &#8211; subsequent attempts to cash the same check
            should be ignored, rejected or initiate an alert process. Note
            that idempotency is not the same as effect-free or stateless: a
            service that always returns the same results is idempotent, but
            only by virtue of the fact that it does not change from invocation
            to invocation.</p>
                              <p>278. Idempotency is an important attribute of a service in an
            environment where there is a significant possibility that the
            interaction between the service provider and consumer may be
            interrupted &#8211; whether by a network issue or simply one of the
            parties dropping out. A strategy for recovering from such a
            breakdown is to attempt to repeat the interaction &#8211; an idempotent
            service is required to ignore such repetitions should the
            transaction have been completed beforehand.</p>
                              <p>279. A service is <span class="bold">
                                    <strong>long-running</strong>
                                 </span>
            if the activities engendered by an interaction are likely to
            persist beyond the immediate interaction itself. For example, a
            classic book selling service might be viewed as a long-running
            service: the activity started by the purchase of the book may take
            days or weeks to complete. It can be important to account for a
            long-running process as it has implications for the kinds of
            infrastructure needed &#8211; both by the service provider and by the
            service consumer &#8211; in order to be able to keep track of the
            progress of the interaction.</p>
                              <p>280. Often, once a business-level contract has been agreed on, it
            can be difficult or impossible to simply cancel the consequences
            of the agreement. This is particularly an issue when the agreement
            of several parties is necessary simultaneously. For example,
            booking a vacation may require a flight ticket as well as a hotel
            room &#8211; without either component the result is not a vacation.
            However, the airline typically will not have a relationship with
            the hotel. If there are no hotel rooms available for the proposed
            vacation then the airline ticket will need to be cancelled.</p>
                              <p>281. The process of reversing a previously completed transaction
            &#8211; backing out of the airline booking for example &#8211; is likely to be
            quite different to the process for the original transaction;
            possibly even involving a different service. Knowledge of such
            compensatory actions is a key aspect of interacting with <span class="bold">

                                 <strong>execution context</strong>
                              </span> of a
          service interaction is the set of infrastructure elements, process
          entities and policy assertions that are deployed as part of the
          instantiated service interaction. In effect, the execution context
          defines the point of contact between abstractions such as service
          descriptions which are mostly about the potential for interaction
          and an actually executing service. It is the point of measurement
          between the service description and reality, between theory and
          practice.</p>
                           <p>283. The execution context is not limited to one side of the
          interaction; rather it concerns the totality of the interaction &#8211;
          including the service provider, the service consumer and the common
          infrastructure needed to mediate the interaction.</p>
                           <p>284. The execution context is central to many aspects of a service
          interaction. It defines, for example, the decision point for any
          policy enforcement relating to the service interaction. Note that a
          policy decision point is not necessarily the same as an enforcement
          point: an execution context is not by itself something that lends
          itself to enforcement. On the other hand, any enforcement mechanism
          of a policy is likely to take into account the particulars of the
          actual service interaction.</p>
                           <p>285. The execution context also allows us to distinguish services
          from one another. Different instances of the same service &#8211; denoting
          interactions between a given service provider and different service
          consumers for example &#8211; are distinguished by virtue of the fact that
          their execution contexts are different.</p>
                           <p>286. Finally, the execution context is also the context in which
          the interpretation of data that is exchanged takes place &#8211; it is
          where the symbol grounding happens as it were. A particular string
          has a particular meaning in a service interaction in a particular
          context &#8211; the execution context.</p>

                        <p>287. There is always a particular purpose associated with interacting
        with a service. Conversely, a service provider (and consumer) often
        has a priori conditions that apply to its interactions. The service
        consumer is trying to achieve some result by interacting with the
        service, as is the service provider. At first sight, such a goal can
        often be expressed as &#8220;trying to get the service to do something&#8221; This
        is sometimes known as the <span class="bold">
                              <strong>real world effect
        </strong>
                           </span> of using a service.</p>
                        <p>288. The internal actions that a service providers and consumers
        perform as a result of participation in service interactions are, by
        definition, private and fundamentally unknowable. By unknowable we
        mean both that external parties cannot see others&#8217; private actions
        and, furthermore should not have explicit knowledge of them. Instead
        we focus on the state that is shared between the parties &#8211; the
        <span class="bold">
                              <strong> shared state</strong>
                           </span>. Actions by service
        providers and consumers lead to modifications of this shared state;
        and that in turn leads to modified <span class="bold">
                              <strong>expectations</strong>
                           </span> by the participants.</p>
                        <p>289. Note that there does not need to be a third party to act as a
        kind of escrow for the shared state between service providers and
        consumers. The elements of the shared state are inferred from the
        communication that has occurred between the participants together with
        other context as necessary. Of course, in the case where adjudication
        is a possibility, it becomes prudent to record the interaction &#8211; so
        that disputes can be arbitrated.</p>
                        <p>290. Although there is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence,

        about the conditions of use of a service; they may also constrain the
        expected real world effects of using a service. The reference model is
        focused primarily on the concept of policies and contracts as they
        apply to services. We are not concerned with the form or
        expressiveness of any language used to express policies and
        contracts.</p>

                           <p>292. A policy is a statement of the obligations, constraints or
          other conditions of use of a given service that expresses intent on
          the part of a participant. More particularly, policies are a way for
          expressing the relationship between the <span class="bold">
                                 <strong>execution context</strong>
                              </span> and the <span class="bold">
                                 <strong>data</strong>
                              </span> and <span class="bold">
                                 <strong>behaviour
          models</strong>
                              </span> associated with the service.</p>
                           <p>293. Conceptually, there are three aspects of policies: the policy
          assertion, the policy owner (sometimes referred to as the policy
          subject) and policy enforcement.</p>
                           <p>294. For example, the assertion: &#8220;All messages are triple-DES
          encrypted is an assertion regarding the forms of messages. As an
          assertion, it is measurable: it may be true or false depending on
          whether the traffic is encrypted or not. Policy assertions are often
          about the way the service is realized; i.e., they are about the
          relationship between the service and its execution context.</p>
                           <p>295. A policy always represents a participant&#8217;s point of view. An
          assertion becomes the policy of a participant when they make it
          their policy. This linking is normally not part of the assertion
          itself. For example, if the service consumer declares that &#8220;Al
          messages are triple-DES encrypted&#8221;, then that reflects the policy of
          the service consumer. This policy is one that may be asserted by the
          service consumer independently of any agreement from the service
          provider.</p>
                           <p>296. Finally, a policy may be enforced. Techniques for the
          enforcement of policies depend on the nature of the policy.
          Conceptually, service policy enforcement amounts to ensuring that
          the policy assertion is consistent with the real world. This might
          mean preventing unauthorized actions to be performed or states to be
          entered into; it can also mean initiating compensatory actions when
          a policy violation has been detected. An unenforceable constraint is
          not a policy; it would be better described as a wish.</p>
                           <p>297. Policies potentially apply to many aspects of SOA: security,
          privacy, manageability, Quality of Service and so on. Beyond such
          infrastructure-oriented policies, participants may also express
          business-oriented policies &#8211; such as hours of business, return
          policies and so on.</p>
                           <p>298. Policy assertions should be written in a form that is
          understandable to, and processable by, the parties to whom the
          policy is directed. Policies may need to be automatically
          interpreted, depending on the purpose and applicability of the
          policy and whether it might affect whether a particular service is
          used or not.</p>
                           <p>299. A natural point of contact between service participants and
          policies associated with the service is in the service description. It would be natural for the service description
          to contain references to the policies associated with the
          service.</p>

                           <p>300. Where a policy is associated with the point of view of
          individual participants, a contract represents an agreement between
          two or more participants. Like policies, contracts can cover a wide
          range of aspects of services: quality of service agreements,
          interface and choreography agreements and commercial
          agreements</p>
                           <p>301. Thus, following the analysis above, a service contract is a
          measurable assertion that governs the requirements and expectations
          of two or more parties. Unlike policy enforcement, which is usually
          the responsibility of the policy owner, contract enforcement may
          involve resolving disputes between the parties to the contract. The
          resolution of such disputes may involve appeals to higher
          authorities.</p>
                           <p>302. Like policies, contracts may be expressed in a form that
          permits automated interpretation. Where a contract is used to codify
          the results of a service interaction, it is good practice to
          represent it in a machine processable form. This facilitates
          automatic service composition, for example. Where a contract is used
          to describe over-arching agreements between service providers and
          consumers, then the priority is likely to make such contracts
          readable by people.</p>

                        <p>303. For a service provider and consumer to interact with each other
        they have to be able to &#8216;see&#8217; each other. This is true for any
        consumer/provider relationship &#8211; including in an application program
        where one program calls another: without the proper libraries being
        present the function call cannot complete. In the case of SOA
        visibility needs to be emphasized because it is not necessarily
        obvious how service participants can see each other to
        interact.</p>
                        <p>304. Visibility is the relationship between service consumers and
        providers that is satisfied when they are able to interact with each
        other. Preconditions to visibility are awareness &#8211; typically the
        initiator in a service interaction must be aware of the other parties
        &#8211; willingness &#8211; the parties must be predisposed to interactions &#8211; and
        ability &#8211; the participants must be able to exchange information as
        part of a service interaction.</p>

                           <p>305. A key aspect of visibility is awareness &#8211; both the service
          provider and the service consumer must have information that would
          lead them to know of the other&#8217;s existence. Technically, the prime
          requirement is that the initiator of a service interaction has
          knowledge of the responder. The fact of a successful initiation is
          often sufficient to inform the responder of the other&#8217;s
          existence.</p>
                           <p>306. Awareness of service offerings is often mediated by various
          discovery mechanisms. For a service consumer (say) to discover a
          service provider, the service provider must be capable of making
          details of the service (notably service description and policies)
          available to potential consumers; and consumers must be capable of
          finding that information.</p>
                           <p>307. Service discoverability requires that the service description
          and policy &#8211; or at least a suitable subset thereof &#8211; be available in
          such a manner and form that, directly or indirectly, an awareness of
          the existence and capabilities of the service can become known to
          potential consumers. The extent to which the discovery is &#8220;pushed by
          the service provider, &#8220;pulled&#8221; by a potential consumer, subject to a
          probe or another method, will depend on many factors.</p>
                           <p>308. For example, a service provider may advertise and promote
          their service by either including it in a service directory or
          broadcasting it to all consumers; potential consumers may broadcast
          their particular service needs in the hope that a suitable service
          responds with a proposal or offer or a service consumer might also
          &#8220;probe&#8221; a entire network to determine if suitable services exist.
          When the demand for a service is higher than the supply, then by
          advertising their needs, potential consumers are likely to be more
          effective then service providers advertising offered
          services.</p>
                           <p>309. One way or another, the potential consumer must acquire a
          sufficient description to evaluate whether the service matches their
          expectations and, if so, the method for the consumer to establish a
          contract and invoke the service.</p>

                           <p>310. Associated with all service interactions is intent &#8211; it is an
          intentional act to initiate and to participate in a service
          interaction. For example, if a service consumer discovers a service
          via its description in a registry, and the consumer initiates an
          interaction, if the service provider does not cooperate then there
          can be no interaction. In some circumstances it is precisely the
          correct behaviour for a service to fail to respond &#8211; for example, it
          is the classic defence against certain denial-of-service
          attacks.</p>
                           <p>311. The extent of a service participant&#8217;s willingness to engage in
          service interactions may be the subject of policies. Those policies
          may be documented in the service description.</p>
                           <p>312. Of course, willingness on the part of service providers and
          consumers to interact is not the same as a willingness to perform
          requested actions. A service provider that rejects all attempts to
          cause it to perform some action may still be fully willing and
          engaged in interacting with the consumer.</p>

          a service, and may even have all the information needed to
          communicate with it. However, if the service is not reachable, for
          example if there is not communication path between the consumer and
          provider, then, effectively, the service is not visible to the
          consumer.</p>
                           <p>314. Reachability is the relationship between service participants
          where they are able to exchange information as part of service
          interactions. Reachability is closely connected to the concept of
          execution context &#8211; an important requirement
          for an execution context is to establish that service participants
          can communicate with each other.</p>

        on when SOA attributes should be implemented within the mid-term time
        frame. A value of zero percent indicates that implementation should
        begin in that year. Conversely, a value of a hundred percent indicates
        that implementation should end in that year. Naturally, measurable
        metrics to quantify progress would have to be agreed upon by the NATO
        nations.</p>

                           <p>316. A service is a contractually defined behaviour that can be
          implemented and provided by a service provider of choice for use by
          service consumer. The term &#8220;services&#8221; does not imply web services;
          although, web services are well known implementations of SOA. Other
          specialized implementations include J2EE<sup>[<a id="d0e3066" href="#ftn.d0e3066" class="footnote">9</a>]</sup> and .NET<sup>[<a id="d0e3070" href="#ftn.d0e3070" class="footnote">10</a>]</sup>.</p>
                           <p>317. The following service group is called the NATO Information
          Infrastructure Core Enterprise Services (NII-CES). NII-CES services
          are available enterprise-wide and are independent of Cross COI
          Services. They are considered the building blocks upon which Cross
          COI Services are created.</p>

          process or other legal or business terms that occur when the service
          is invoked. For example, if a service consumer invokes a service
          that places a purchase order to the service provider, and the
          execution is successful, it may result in a financial responsibility
          to the service provider or some other legal entity.</p>

          standard for declaring a service is desirable when building an
          infrastructure. The service instance consists of the technical
          parameters, constraints and policies that define the terms to invoke
          the service instance. Every service should include a service
          definition in a standardized format. This enables service consumers,
          human or another service, to examine the service definition and
          evaluate the following questions:</p>

          accessible manner to potential consumers. It does so by using one of
          several advertising method; catalogue or webpage publishing,
          Pulling, or Pushing.</p>
                           <p>330. In the Pull methodology, potential service consumers request
          the service provider to send them the service description. This pull
          methodology may be invoked as a service itself.</p>
                           <p>331. In the Push methodology, the service provider, or its agent,
          sends the service description to potential service consumers. The
          push and pull methodologies may work together to facilitate
          advertising services through a third party in a pattern of publish
          and subscribe.</p>

                           <p>333. Discovery occurs when a potential consumer obtains information
          about the existence of a service, its applicable parameters and
          terms. Discovery does not constitute authorization to execute
          against the service; although these details may be included in the

                              <p>337. A Registry/Repository is a component where users can store
            and manage artefacts required for their enterprise to function.
            This includes artefacts that require sharing among more than one
            user (such as XML schemas and web-service descriptions). The
            repository component provides an intrinsic storage mechanism that
            is bound to the registry such that the registry knows about any
            auditable events to the artefacts in the repository.</p>

                              <p>338. A Directory is an interface that provides information to
            bind to artefacts. Those who own or control the artefacts may make
            an entry into the directory to reference the artefact and explain
            how to bind to it. Others may retrieve this information and use it
            to bind to the artefacts. The main drawback of the directory is
            that it has no control or notification if an artefact is deleted,
            changed or replaced, and the directory may not be able to indicate
            these events to users.</p>
                              <p>339. Both Registry/Repository and Directory implementations allow
            for federation (also called replication). This functionality
            allows content from one implementation to be replicated or
            referenced from within other implementations.</p>
                              <p>340. Several standards exist to constrain Registry/Repository and
            Directory implementations. The most prevalent standards are
            ISO/IEC 11179 Part 315 (an ISO standard for metadata registries),
            the OASIS ebXML Registry-Repository Technical Specifications16 and
            the OASIS Universal Description and Discovery Interface (UDDI)
            Technical Specification</p>
                              <p>341. The OASIS UDDI specification is available from the OASIS
            website under the technical committee&#8217;s home page area at
            www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=uddi-spec.</p>
                              <p>342. Standards such as Bluetooth TM use a broadcast-type
            methodology to advertise their services to other Bluetooth devices
            that are within range.</p>

                           <p>343. When invoking a service, certain parameters may be required to help the service fulfil the service request.  The service may also pass parameters back to the service consumer.  To understand any required parameters serialization, an artefact is required to specify the associated data models for the services.  Even if no parameters are used, SOA requires a base component to declare this in a format that is understandable to service consumers.</p>

          the service contract specifies a set of technical data, and possibly
          business information. The contract is between whoever is providing
          the Web service, and whoever is consuming the Web service. Put in
          the simplest terms, the contract provides details about the service
          being offered by the provider. By agreeing to a contract, both sides
          understand exactly what will be provided.</p>

            A low-level contract expresses how you communicate, and what the
            expectations of communications are. But that low-level contract is
            not nearly as important as the higher-level contracts. At a

            these contracts frequently have business implications, not just
            technical implications. For example, a contract may include
            details of how the service will be authenticated, and so have
            details about authentication, encryption and authorization. A
            typical high-level contract could include the following:</p>
