                     <p>185. By definition, a reference model is an abstract framework for
    understanding the relationships among the entities within a specified
    environment. It enables the development of specific architectures using
    consistent standards or specifications supporting that environment.</p>
                     <p>186. A basic reference model will consists of the smallest set of
    unifying concepts, rules and relationships within a particular problem
    area, and is independent of specific standards, technologies,
    implementations, or other concrete details.</p>
                     <p>187. The relationship between the Reference Model and the implementation
    of a particular abstract concept is illustrated in <a class="xref" href="apc.html#v1e-trm" title="Figure C.1. NTRM Services View">Figure C.1</a>.</p>
                     <p>188. Reference models are a standard definitive document or conceptual
    representation of a system or process. It provides a structure which
    allows the modules and interfaces of a system to be described in a
    consistent manner. In the context of near-future NATO environments, member
    nations could use these general models in designing architectures for
    net-enabled systems and platforms. These models represent the mid-term
    common framework that NATO nations can build to. A common framework is one
    of the keys to ensuring interoperability.</p>
                     <p>189. General reference models presented by industry do not take into
    account the typical Military or NATO unique situation. In the far-term,
    the NNEC approach will require us to establish a NATO Reference Model for
    services that tailored to complement the NATO mission.</p>
                     <p>190. Reference models are a standard definitive document or conceptual
    representation of a system or process. It provides a structure which
    allows the modules and interfaces of a system to be described in a

    systems and platforms.</p>
                     <p>191. Such assets can then participate in an NCO environment, by acting as
    interoperable nodes on a fixed or mobile ad hoc network. Once an element
    operates as a node, it can discover and register its needs and
    capabilities on a network, and use that network to communicate, interact
    and function with other nodes. The ultimate result is greater mission
    effectiveness.</p>

                              <p>192. Within the context of information systems, a Technical
          Reference Model (TRM) is a generally accepted construct that
          provides a basic set of concepts and a conceptual framework for
          identifying and resolving standards issues.</p>
                              <p>193. The main purpose of the NATO TRM (NTRM) is to structure the
          standards listed in the NATO Interoperability Standards and Profiles
          (NISP). As such, it should be a stable model and modifications
          should be made very carefully.</p>

                              <p>194. The NTRM focuses on separating data from applications and
          applications from the computing platform. This is a key principle
          when striving to attain a true open system environment. The NTRM
          provides the definitions necessary for designing and defining
          architectures and related service components. It also identifies
          service areas (i.e., capabilities that have been grouped together by
          functions), as well as their interfaces.</p>
                              <p>195. As indicated above, the NTRM is designed to decouple the
          application and external environment from the platform. This allows
          for portability of the application and independence from the
          external devices (e.g., disk, mouse, keyboard, LAN). This is
          accomplished by defining the application program interface (API) and
          external environment interface (EEI) accordingly.</p>

            general- and special purpose systems. From the perspective of the
            application software entity, these services are provided by an
            application platform whether the particular services are provided
            from the local platform or from remote platforms that may comprise
            one or more nodes of a larger distributed system. The NTRM can
            also be applied in a distributed environment and networked
            environment.</p>

              Different groups of individuals within and across the various

              restricted to authorized users. Satisfaction of this requirement
              has traditionally been accomplished by the implementation of
              separate information systems. Organizations cannot continue to
              afford to implement separate information systems to satisfy this
              requirement, nor is it effective to require the user to change
              interface components every time the need arises to operate with
              a different restricted data set. Significant benefit will accrue
              when an individual information system can effectively support
