                           <p>28. In August 2004 the NATO Strategic Commanders described the
      following framework for transformation shown in <a class="xref" href="apb.html#v1f2-framework" title="Figure B.1. Framework for Transformation">Figure B.1</a> which is structured around Transformation
      Goals and Objectives. A central tenet of this Bi-Strategic Command
      (Bi-SC) strategic vision is that future operations will be effects-based
      in that they will involve all instruments of Alliance power, political,
      diplomatic, economic and military, exercised in an integrated fashion to
      create a desired effect in order to achieve a strategic objective.
      Regarding the transformation goals, NATO must be able to achieve
      Coherent Effects, Decision Superiority and Joint Deployment and
      Sustainment. In order to achieve these goals, the NNEC Vision &amp;
      Concept identified specific areas where NATO needs to conduct research
      and develop concepts to improve capabilities. These are entitled
      Transformation Areas. NNEC is one of them and is seen as a key enabler
      to nearly all the others.</p>

                              <p>29. In November 2002 the NATO C3 Board (NC3B) agreed that there was
        a need to develop NATO NEC. NNEC is based on adapting national
        initiatives like the U.S. Network Centric Warfare (NCW) and the UK
        Network Enabled Capability (NEC).</p>
                              <p>30. In January 2004, 12 Nations, through the NC3B, sponsored the
        NNEC Feasibility Study. Version 1.0 of the Feasibility Study was
        delivered to the sponsoring nations and version 2.0 was delivered to
        all NATO nations in October 2005. In December 2005 the NC3B endorsed
        the NNEC Feasibility Study recommendations and its release to Partners
        and industry.</p>
                              <p>31. The aims of the Feasibility Study are listed below:</p>
                              <div class="itemizedlist">
                                 <ul class="itemizedlist">

                                    </li>
                                    <li class="listitem">
                                       <p>Identify types of C2ISR capabilities required to enable NATO
            Network Centric Operations</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li class="listitem">
                                       <p>Develop a strategy and roadmap for realization of a
            Networking and Information Infrastructure (NII)</p>
                                    </li>
                                 </ul>
                              </div>
                              <p>32. Key conclusions in the Feasibility Study included the need for a
        highly interconnected CIS to support future operational needs of the
        Alliance; and the need for a NII based on a federation of NATO and
        National systems. The NISP must be structured to support the
        development of the NII.</p>
                              <p>33. Another major conclusion of the NNEC FS is that change is a
        constant. In order to make change manageable a model for NNEC Maturity
        Levels has been developed along the structure of four maturity stages.
        The NISP must be restructured to align with these stages. As a first
        step alignment with four stages was not yet feasible.</p>
                              <p>34. The NNEC FS also concluded that the required flexibility for
        federating NATO and national systems into an NII can only be reached
        by adopting the service-oriented approach. In practice, this leads to
        a need for identification of a coherent and comprehensive services
        framework, including strict interface definitions. The framework
        should be provided as a result from architecture work (typically
        Overarching Architecture). The solution patterns for services and
        interface definitions need to be developed using time-phased standards

          NATO, and coalition partners. The NII can be defined as:

          leased communication an computing systems, information services,
          software, data, security services, and other associated capabilities
          necessary to achieve Information Superiority for the Nations and
          organisations contributing to the NII. The NII includes service
          interfaces between participants including NATO nations, NATO
          agencies, coalition partners, and non-NATO users including potential
          participation from Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), civilian
          police, emergency services, and local governmental groups. The NII
          provides capabilities from all operating locations (e.g. government
          facilities, headquarters, posts, camps, stations, facilities, mobile
          platforms, deployed sites, and agencies).</p>
                                 <p>39. The NII will also be made of service-based systems provided by
          multiple sovereign nations as well as NATO itself and will operate
          on a co-operative basis. It encompasses not only the physical and
          personnel resources necessary to plan, implement, and operate the
          actual infrastructure, but also includes the necessary agreed
          processes to ensure continued coherent evolution and effectiveness
          of the NII. The infrastructure will be a dynamic heterogeneous
          entity with configuration changing with the environment and
          technological advances. This environment is considerably different
          from a national-only environment and will therefore require greater
          emphasis on standardisation and interoperability, not only for
          equipment but also in management methodologies including Service
          Level Agreement (SLA) management.</p>
                                 <p>40. Inclusion of a service-based system within the NII does not
          imply ownership or control by any entity other than the contributor.
          Contributed systems are independently managed and controlled by
          their owners within the framework of the Federation-of-Systems
          (FoS), which is a concept explained later in the Chapter. However
          inclusion of a system within the NII does imply that the
          contribution will comply with agreed NII community policies,
          security requirements, and procedures.</p>

                                 <p>44. The Internet is the best known example today of a
          Federation-of-Systems. There is no central control, and
          participation is through collaboration and co-operation to meet the
          objectives of the federation. A FoS is characterised by a greater
          degree of autonomy, heterogeneity, and distribution than is found in
          a system-of-systems (SoS) approach, which also involves the "joining
          together" of systems, but allows for a degree of centralised
          control. Although it is thought that the NII will operate as a FoS,
          it is also possible that there may be times when nations may wish to
          allow for the centralised management of segments of their systems,
          in order to meet shared operational objectives. It is important that
          the implementation of the NII allow for this possibility.</p>
                                 <p>45. The need to support national autonomy in the implementation
          and operation of the NII forces the adoption of participation models
          capable of supporting a flexible, adaptable approach to
          participation in the NII. It is clear that the successful
          implementation of the NII will require architectures, technical
          solutions, and operational procedures beyond that which any single
          nation will require or can provide.</p>

                                 <p>47. The strategy for developing future C3 capabilities is based on
          the Capability-Based Planning (CBP) approach. A capabilities-based
          paradigm focuses more on how an adversary might fight than on who
          the adversary might be and where a war might occur. It requires us
          to identify capabilities that military forces will need to deter and
          defeat a particular type of adversary. This approach involves a
          functional analysis of operational requirements, leading to the
          identification of capabilities required to accomplish a mission.
          Once the required capability inventory is defined, the most cost
          effective and efficient options to satisfy these requirements are
          sought. This process involves the mapping of operational capability
          requirements to a supporting set of system functional requirements,
          which identifies the system capabilities required to support a
          mission.</p>
                                 <p>48. The CBP methodology builds on the CBP approach introduced as
          part of the 2003 NATO Defence Requirements Review processes and the
          CBP planning approach used within the NATO Overarching Architecture
          and provides a new approach to conducting NATO C3 planning.</p>
                                 <p>49. While the concept of CBP is key to the identification of
          required system functionality, the concept of Service Oriented
          Architectures (SOAs) is key to meeting those requirements and is an
          essential part of the overall strategy.</p>
                                 <p>50. SOAs provide a flexible modular approach for implementing
          system functional requirements in the form of services. This
          strategy for developing future C3 capabilities responds to the need
          to for a flexible, modular approach for meeting future Consultation
          and C2 requirements.</p>
                                 <p>51. The use of SOAs has emerged as a major trend within the
          commercial sector and among nations developing NNEC type
          capabilities, because of the flexibility they provide in sharing
          information and information processing capabilities. SOAs provide
          mechanisms for using existing information services as well as
          providing a basis for developing new more advanced information
          services, utilising existing services. Such mechanisms will allow
          many Consultation and C2 needs to be satisfied by linking together
          existing information services in a modular, flexible fashion that
          can be readily adapted to changing operational needs. The
          flexibility provided through the use of SOAs is particularly well
          suited to supporting the needs of coalition based Network-Centric
          Operations.</p>

                                 <p>52. The Information and Integration component of the NII is
          characterised by the use of Service Oriented Architectures to expose
          software functions as consumable services that can be discovered and
          invoked across the network. The use of SOAs ease application and
          data sharing and provide a flexible mechanism for reusing existing
          services to enable the development of new, value-added information
          services.</p>
                                 <p>53. A primary goal of the SOA approach is to make information
          resources available to all consumers on the network and support the
          efficient discovery and delivery of that information to the
          consumer.</p>
                                 <p>54. The use of the SOA approach requires that we adopt a common
          Net-Centric Data strateg to ensure that we make information visible,
          accessible, understandable and interoperable with other sources of
          information. Trusting the information we get and trusting that the
          information we supply will be handled correctly will be a key
          success factor. The ability to provide flexible, secure, role-based,
          information access that can be quickly configured to support
          changing policy is foundational to the long-term success of the
          NII.</p>
                                 <p>55. Realising the benefits of the SOA approach will require that
          we agree on a standardised set of foundational services covering
          such areas as service discovery security, metadata management,
          identify management, service management and mediation.</p>

                                 <p>56. The need for improved system interoperability is clearly
          spelled out in the latest versions of the NATO Interoperability
          Management Plan (NIMP) and NATO Architecture Framework (NAF).</p>
                                 <p>57. In order to achieve the principle of flexible
          interoperability, a change of focus is required: from the idea of
          standalone, stovepipe systems (i.e. platform-oriented) to the idea
          of shareable, universal information (i.e. service-oriented).</p>
                                 <p>58. This "service oriented" architectural view indicates that
          rather than information being inextricably tied to a particular
          system, it should be available to all who need it (and have rights
          to it). Information would still have "consumers" and "producers" but
          the assignment of these roles would be dynamic and would cross
          system boundaries.</p>
                                 <p>59. The guiding principle of information services is the adoption
          of service oriented architecture (SOA) and where appropriate, the
          implementation of web services.</p>
                                 <p>60. A simple definition of an SOA is "a broad set of concepts that
          enable units of functionality to be provided and consumed as
          'services'. This essentially simple concept can and should be used,
          not just for web services, but also at each tier of the
          architecture, in order to compartmentalise and provide flexibility".
          For example, an SOA allows the use of 'thin clients' by tailoring
          the provided services to the needs and capabilities of a consumer.
          This allows a more flexible use of hardware resources and is more
          cost-effective (i.e. a reduced number of software licenses).</p>
                                 <p>61. In an SOA, loosely coupled systems view one another as
          "services", accessible via a standard interface without knowledge of
          the underlying implementation of the service. A "registry" manages
          and directs the interactions between services. Data is exchanged in
          a common format using standard protocols, which helps to ensure
          compatibility. All this allows user-to-system or direct
          system-to-system interactions that have not previously been
          generally feasible.</p>
                                 <p>62. The concept of every system viewing others as "services" in a
          loosely coupled manner is coherent with the concept of NNEC being a
          FoS. From an SOA perspective, it means that IIS is to be thought of
          as a federation of services, where any NATO or national information
          system will be autonomous and provide specific services by means of
          implementing a standardised service interface.</p>
                                 <p>63. Thus, it will be necessary not only to define the standards to
          regulate the implementation of such interfaces but also a set of
          service interoperability points that will facilitate the
          interoperation of similar ser ices provided by different nations in
          a seamless manner.</p>

                              <p>64. In June 2005 the Military Committee tasked Allied Command
        Transformation (ACT) to develop the NNEC Strategic Framework as a
        means of describing NNEC developmental activities. The Strategic
        Framework will consist of the following documents: NNEC Vision and
        Concept, NNEC Roadmap(s), NNEC Business Case(s), Compendium of NNEC
        related Architectures, and detailed Plan. Although the NNEC
        Feasibility Study was not identified as Strategic Framework document,
        it is recognized as providing the technical foundation for NNEC
        through the NII. The development of the Strategic Framework is
