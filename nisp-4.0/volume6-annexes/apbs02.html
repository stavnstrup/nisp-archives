    NATO and Partner Nations have initiated network enabled programs in their
    respective nations. NNEC will be a federation of NATO and National service
    based systems, with the Nations contributing around 90 percent of the
    capabilities, it is important that the standards and profiles described in
    the NISP take into account the ongoing developments in the nations.</p>

                        <p>66. The C4 development started in Finland in the 1980's. At that time,
      all systems were developed separately for the Army, Navy, and the Air
      Force, thus resulting in a situation with a large number of distributed
      stove-piped systems. Although these systems have served us well in the
      past, their lifecycle is coming towards an end, and new systems need to
      be developed to serve our current and future needs. We face the same
      challenges as many other militaries as we realize that it is not
      affordable to develop new systems on top of the old ones by patching and
      bridging gaps. Furthermore, there is a limit to which technical, data,
      and application integration can take us. Therefore we have decided to
      give up most of our old systems by 2010. This decision became the
      starting point for the development of our IC4I and forms the basis for
      our Network Enabled Defence (NED), which comprises a domestic roadmap to
      which crisis management is aligned.</p>
                        <p>67. The Finnish view on NED is that it is a working title for a
      concept that uses the principles of Network Enabled Capabilities for
      providing total defence (also called homeland security). Finland has a
      long tradition in total defence, where the armed forces cooperate with
      other governmental agencies and industry to secure the functions vital
      to the society. NED is defined to describe how future networks with
      improved and integrated information and weapon systems can enable
      command and control in joint and territorial operations with multiple
      partners. The basic requirement in our system development is
      interoperability with the international development. Thus, there is no
      significant difference whether the crisis is in Finland or somewhere
      else, nor is there a technical difference whether the coalition is lead
      by the UN, EU, NATO or a nation.</p>
                        <p>68. The Finnish approach to NED is very pragmatic and based on
      incremental development. We place high emphasis on innovation
      opportunities that are technically feasible, cost-efficient, and
      organizationally achievable. NED is not seen as a goal, but as a journey
      in the right direction together with partners. Especially industry
      partnerships are considered valuable, as they have the research and
      production capabilities needed to turn innovations into solutions and
      applications - again, real implementations, not just visions and
      theories. One example of such partnership is the establishment of a
      Network Centric Operations Centre of Excellence (NCO CoE) together with
      IBM in Finland.</p>
                        <p>69. The first task that we did was to rationalize system development
      in order to cut the number of overlapping systems. This lead to system
      centralization, and the idea of "the network as the computer" emerged,
      which in practise means that thin clients capable of doing local
      processing are used, but the applications and data storage are performed
      via the network. We also decided to take a leap into a SOA-based
      approach. The two main issues in this first phase are the reliance on
      COTS as well as our architecture development. In our architecture
      development, we have found the usage of overarching and reference
      architectures as drivers for change, and ended up with an overarching
      architecture and two reference architectures (C4I and administrative).
      In the near future, there will be two additional reference
      architectures, which are shared with other agencies for collaboration
      purposes. As for using COTS, we have taken a very pragmatic approach in
      building and deploying our systems. For example, for voice communication
      we have developed a TETRA based system, which was gradually deployed in
      Finland as well as in international exercises and operations, such as in
      the Finnish battalion in Kosovo (2002), the Nordic PfP Exercise (2003),
      MN Brigade (C) in Kosovo (2003), and MN TF Althea (2004). During the
      years 2001-2004 we developed civilian crisis management systems, which
      were based on the idea that whatever can be deployed in our national
      defence can be used in international operations as well. Another
      developed COTS product was the Deployed COTS Network (DCN), which
      connects virtually any digital and analogue network together. In less
      than four months we procured, tested trained, and deployed a brigade
      level DCN to KFOR.</p>
                        <p>70. The second step involves a functional change and is concerned with
      information sharing. At this stage, SOA is used as the basis for the
      architecture. At the moment, we have three main experiences developed or
      in development for the second phase. One is the Network Enabled
      Operations Centre (NEOC), where we tested the centralization of
      information powerhouses into the core network. The concept of
      information powerhouses basically means that all information is
      centralized into a few server hotels, which are connected to the
      backbone and accessible through the access networks. The demonstrator
      proved increased survivability, better situational awareness, and
      brought new processes and a new C4 structure. The second issue is
      SECNET, the interagency networking concept. This is still under
      development, but we are getting there in a pragmatic way, developing
      services that can be shared between authorities. The third concept is
      METO, which is a Sea Surveillance Information System (SSIS) shared by
      the Navy, Border control, and Maritime traffic safety, and thus
      coordinated by the defence ministry, ministry of transportation, and the
      interior ministry.</p>
                        <p>71. In the third phase, we are concerned with a cultural change that
      involves collaboration based on the SOA approach. To mention two
      examples, we have build proof-of-concepts for a joint Common Operational
      Picture (COP) service. In the first PoC, we tested the scalability of
      having a "mother database" with all information. This database was
      reachable from the Defence Staff through a common portal. Information
      was collected from various local environments, which all had a picture
      of their own environment. The PoC showed us that the technology worked.
      In the second PoC, we tested what we call the "child's architecture",
      where some of the local environments are detached from the "mother
      environment". The idea is that the detached unit is able to operate on
      its own even without a network connection, seeing only its own
      environment. However, as the network connection is resumed, it should be
      possible to rejoin to the common environment. The focus was on the
      scalability of SOA, information handling when coming back online, and
      integrity issues. In this PoC we scaled down to brigade and battalion
      level, but it is possible to scale it further down to team or even
      individual fighter level.</p>
                        <p>72. We have learnt many lessons on our still ongoing journey towards
      NED. We believe that our pragmatic and incremental approach together
      with strong industrial partnership, where development and deployment
      lifecycles can be brought down to 18 months, is a good way to go ahead.
      Collaboration with NATO in architectural development, using the idea of
      overarching and reference architectures, and working together on open
      service interface descriptions has proven valuable. Also testing the
      systems in exercises and deploying them on the field in various
      operations have given us a lot of experience.</p>
                        <p>73. Still, several challenges remain. The main challenge is IA, which
      often is a hot potato that nobody wants to address. This is the next
      challenge that we will really focus on solving. The IA challenge is
      especially difficult at the moment due to the cultural change related to
      the transition from "need to know" to "need to hide" and "duty to
      share". Whereas communication security has been addressed by various
      security protocols, network and content security are still open
      questions. For example, the concept of CBIS/MLIS has suffered from a
      standstill for several years.</p>
                        <p>74. Another challenge is the difficulty in integrating differ nt
      approaches from NATO, EU, the government and industry. However, we are
      hoping that the industry will help us solve the problem, and hence we
      will continue with our strong partnership approach. Furthermore, future
      services are still unknown, thus leading to "ad hoc system design". The
      best we can do at the moment is to try to develop a common and generic
      environment, in which to fit future services in a standard way. Also
      decomposing current systems to services provided by applications using
      core and common services is a challenge.</p>
                        <p>75. The biggest challenge, perhaps, is not technical, but cultural.
      The user needs to feel "a return of investment" for his efforts to learn
      new ways of doing business. Training and educating users is one thing,
      but the real challenge is to get people to truly adopt the concept of
      collaboration in a network-centric environment using unified process
      workflows.</p>

          these headquarters. In order to optimise those interconnections from
          a personnel perspectives and a cost point of view (equipments,
          leased lines..), the intention is to setup a permanent network.
          Furthermore, this permanent network will facilitate the exchange of
          information with NATO and will enable France to be in line with the
          NNEC perspectives to offer the available services to all the
          military users.</p>

              efficiency it would be easier to have only one workstation to
              access directly to the right information instead of using a
              swivel chair and disquettes (or USB keys). Another aspect of
              this point of view is to adopt the maxim "train as you fight",
              and as such it is highly desirable to have the ability to use
              NATO and French tools on the same network.</p>

              specific CIS team dedicated to the support of this gateway. It
              is not easy to deploy and configure it. On the other hand, using
              only one IP network between NATO and France has eased the
              overall deployment. The compromise that should be made is to
              avoid the deployment of those gateways on theatre where the

        when the different systems were available. Each time the participation
        of a French unit was required an extension of the NATO system was
        establish to connect them. The result is that each functional system
        has added direct link and specific network to enable the required
        exchange of information. The number of transmission links has grown
        and equally the number of gateways and crypto devices. One of the
        links might be overloaded at a period of the day but we are not able
        to use another link that might be free at the same time. The teams in
        charge of these equipments have no centralized management tool and no
        possibility to improve the quality of service for the different
        communities of users.</p>

        links. For the moment, direct connections between each French location
        to the NATO network have been established. Hence the number of leased
        lines is important and to allow a communication at NATO secret level
        between Brest and Toulon for NATO purposes the communication is done
        via SHAPE. The optimization is not done on the different links and the
        level of redundancy for each location is relatively low. The proposed
        way to improve the actual situation is to:</p>

        give the opportunity for the end-user to have only one computer on his
        desk accessing all the needed services. The first step is to take into
        account the messaging and webaccess services to enable the access to
        ICC, MCCIS, BICES-webserver, WISE and CRONOS. All the "supporting"
        services like DNS, PKI, NTP will be available for the different
        systems. The flows of information between the national side and the
        NATO sides will be filtered in the appropriate gateway.</p>

          phase of the new maritime system that France is developing: SIC21.
          This system will have to exchange information with MCCIS and several
          others NATO systems. As this validation phase will start during
          summer 2007, it is envisaged to use the IEG that was used during the
          NRF5 rotation with some minor changes (authorization of MCCIS
          flows). At the same period of time, the air community will start to
          move on the NNS: the CASPOA (Analysis and Simulation centre) for air
          operations preparation, which is a NATO Centre of Excellence,
          located in Taverny (close to Paris), the CCOA (Air Operation Centre)
          located in Lyon and the CDAOA (Air Defence and Air Operations
          Command) located in Paris will be connected.</p>
                              <p>88. At the end of 2008, all the ICC and MCCIS clients located in
          France should be able to work directly from their computers on the
          NNS. This means on the contrary that the people located on the
          theatre will still require direct links to NATO WAN.</p>

          network. On one side new clients will have the opportunity to access
          those services and on the other side new services will be added on
          the network. The new clients concerned by this migration on NNS are
          the squadrons and air headquarters that can participate in NRF/HRF
          such as flying units, ARS, Ships and headquarters and the new
          headquarters created in France The pace for moving the units will be
          based on the next rotation of NRF where France is playing a
          component command role.</p>
                              <p>90. For NRF 11, France will be Land Component Command and still
          keeps two options for its interconnection. The first would be to use
          the FR NNS and the second to have a direct connection to NSWAN. The
          choice is depending on the organization of the Joint Force Command
          leading the rotation.</p>
                              <p>91. For the NRF 12 France, Air Component command, it is assumed
          that the FR NNS will be used as it was done during the rotation 5.
          The only difference would be the availability of more
          services.</p>

          some client workstations were deployed in various locations. France
          has contracted a support with a company to install and maintain the
          various computers. This contract is coming to its end, thus there is
          an opportunity to re-analyse the relevance of such a contract and
          the associated cost. Some clients will not be connected with the
          contractor because there are out of the boundary of the initial
          contract. France has made the decision to int grate this "service"
          in the FR NNS. No more upgrade of the actual network is planned; all
          the new users will be connected via the FR NNS.</p>

          different headquarters during the 2007-2008 period to setup an
          architecture that will support all the workstations spread out in
          many places in France. The upgrade of ICC from the actual version to
          2.7.1, then 2.8 will give an ideal integration period to migrate
          towards the new approach. After that migration it is assumed that
          network upgrades will be necessary for the air community for the
          arrival of ACCS. All the network evolutions will be taken into

          deployed. To enable interconnection between network handling NATO
          Secret information and network handling Mission Secret information,
          it will be necessary to develop an IEG Case C. The location of this
          gateway is still under discussion and need to be further
          investigated. The main objective for this interconnection is to
          offer all the NATO IP services to the different communities of

          accurate analysis must be undertaken to verify how and when they
          could go on the national network. That is the case for ACCS and
          Bi-SC-AIS. This analysis should be followed by a testing phase to

          quality of service will be spread on all the IP networks, and
          operational priorities agreed within the nations, this could evolve
          towards a unique network on which all the services would be made

          most of the data needed for command and control functions, it must
          be recognize that non-IP networks will last for at least 5 years.
          Thus it is important for the services that they support to guarantee
          that the interoperability between the non-IP systems within NATO
          nations and PfP nations will continue until the transition phase to
          IP is accomplished. The services concerned are real-time service
          (e.g. Link 16, circuit between radar and CAOC,...), telegraphy,
          circuit switched and packet switched services.</p>

                              <p>100. To foster and federate initiatives to improve military actions
          effectiveness within a coalition force, information is the key
          element. Information management and effect control to reach the
          desired end-st te have to be taken into account joint, inter-agency
          and international aspects development of interoperability, using
          state of the art methods will accelerate adaptation towards using
          enterprise services across the nations and appropriate networking.
          The necessity to accelerate the acquisition of the systems and to
          optimise spending will tailor the experimentation process. In order
          to take advantage of all the technology opportunities, a structured
          but pragmatic approach will be taken to enable the different program
          managers to take into account the interoperability challenges in an
          international context. In particular, studies need to be done to
          identify the criteria to determine when Service Oriented
          Architecture is the right approach and, when appropriate, propose a
          migration plan in accordance with the other nations involved.</p>

                           <p>104. NEC cannot be bought. Furthermore, the realisation of NEC is an
        evolutionary process without a strictly defined beginning or end. It
        is a process of growth, comparable to the process of change that many
        organisations go through in order to stay up-to-date in the field of
        information and communication technology. Doctrines, processes,
        command and control, organisations, personnel and materiel must
        develop in a coherent and evolutionary way. That, therefore, is the
        approach that the Defence organisation will use towards the
        development of NEC. As a result, NEC will be introduced into the
        Netherlands armed forces in a gradual and manageable way. This
        approach is characterised by the following principles:</p>
                           <div class="itemizedlist">
                              <ul class="itemizedlist">

                                    <p>combination of bottom-up activities aimed at the development
            of the necessary information infrastructure and top-down
            activities aimed at concept development with regard to the future
            capabilities;</p>
                                 </li>
                                 <li class="listitem">
                                    <p>a step-by-step approach, i.e. a learning path where
            experiments are used, in close cooperation with developers and
            users, to reduce the risks as much as possible and make users
            aware of the new possibilities of NEC as soon as possible;</p>
                                 </li>
                                 <li class="listitem">
                                    <p>co-evolutionary approach: the balance among the various
            aspects of development is constantly monitored.</p>
                                 </li>
                              </ul>
                           </div>
                           <p>105. For several NEC systems, the Defence organisation takes itself
        the lead in the development. This approach is different to the
        approach used by many other nations, who develop specifications and
        delegate the actual development to industry based upon these
        specifications. TITAAN and ISIS, for example, are being developed by
        the Dutch Army itself, with support of industry.</p>
                           <p>106. The Defence organisation distinguishes three types of innovation
        on the path towards NEC:</p>

            and its integration in the network. Flexible and incremental
            procurement strategies, in which the insight into the functional
            demands and the best way to meet those demands gradually increase,
            tie in with this. This also requires a more intensive cooperation
            with the industry. In the development of new capabilities,
            NEC-requirements will be taken aboard in the design, just as is
            the case now with the Joint Strike Fighter.</p>

          interoperability is an integral concept throughout JPOW. "Three,
          two, one, fire", a Greek officer, headphones over his coalblack
          hair, counts down. A trembling explosion; a grey white cloud of
          smoke like a small cauliflower. An orange-coloured rocket races up
          from the launch site and hisses its way into a cloudless sky.
          Shortly before the projectile intercepts a small target aircraft, it
          is destroyed from the ground, and its shattered remains fall into
          the ice-blue Mediterranean waters off the coast near the NATO
          shooting range on the rocky island of Crete. This pandemonium is
          repeated three times. It is D-Day in the international air defence

          Missile Group of the De Peel airforce base shoots four ageing
          rockets into the firmament. JPOW is somewhere in between Star Wars,
          Star Trek and the US Strategic Defence Initiative. The foundation of
          the project was laid by the Netherlands, motivated by the first Gulf
          war (Source: Defensiekrant (MOD periodical), 20 April 2006).</p>

          carried out the first Dutch Joint NEC experiment. This experiment
          involved setting up a distributed experimenting environment which
          linked several locations together. Simulated operational sea, land
          and air systems successfully networked their actions in a single

          multinational orientation. Individual units must be interoperable to
          be able to function in a multinational flotilla. A recent example
          (late 2005 - early 2006) was the Dutch contribution to Task Force
          150, which was responsible for so-called maritime security
          operations in an area stretching from the coast of Somalia to the
          Arabian Gulf. TF 150 consisted of a great variety of navy vessels
          (including an air defence and command frigate), maritime patrol
          vessels, unmanned aircraft and shipborne helicopters. All these
          means contributed to the joint mission: identifying and detecting
          suspect vessels, boarding and searching vessels, collecting
          information and halting suspect vessels and arresting their crew.
          Through use of the American CENTRIX network and the Coalition Forces
          Intelligence Cell, the vessels could exchange information (such as
          photographs) with each other and with shore authorities directly by
          e-mail and chat, thus ensuring that the waiting time for merchant
          ships could be reduced to a minimum.</p>

          Dutch leadership, the language barrier was, considering the
          operational circumstances, a real problem. Because information was
          shared with the coalition partners using ISIS, and this information
          was also represented graphically, there would soon be a shared
          understanding of the operational situation and emerging crises could
          be overcome swiftly and effectively. It is also thanks to ISIS that
          Task Force Fox has gone down in history as a successful NATO
          mission.</p>

                           <p>113. National policies and directives support the bringing in of the NEC model nationally as they do its contribution to the multinational efforts. Both, information superiority and interoperability are considered a force multiplier/booster at the Spanish Military Strategy. The National Defence Act speaks of a call to "urge a transformation of our Armed Forces in line with a new model which would give them advanced technological capabilities". The Organic Law of National Defence and the Military Planning Directive requires that "Armed Forces are to be organized and trained in such an advanced technological manner that they will thus enjoy combat advantage, fewer losses and less damage and be networking operative"</p>
                           <p>114. Aware of the very high number of actors and lines of work involved on Spanish NEC, in order to assure the proper co-ordination, CHOD set up a NEC Study and Developing Board (CEDENEC). This commission comes under the Chief of the Joint Staff responsibilities and is presided over by the Head of the CIS Division drawing its members from Defence staff HQ Spain and the HQs of each of the Services along with the Materiel and Armaments Board (DGAM), the CIS Inspectorate (IGECIS) and the Policy Board (DIGENPOL).</p>
                           <p>115. This organization gives the specific structure set up for the improving of the initiatives coherence that bring in other pertinent bodies, and for the generating proposals including those approaches required to make of Spanish NEC a reality and its contribution to NATO NEC a fact. This working whole structure, that includes a working groups subestructure and is supported by the Spanish NEC Office, is charged with giving leadership to NEC during its initial phases by answering questions as to its definition, objectives, requirements, criteria as to its functional structure, information infrastructure, interoperability and any other matter that might have an effect on the development of NEC. It is also to promote the NEC knowledge within the Spanish Armed Forces, specially to all the involved bodies in its definition and development and to manage NEC related information.</p>

                              <p>116. Spain is aware that there is no single sequence of long-term planned baselines, but an approximate direction of progress, frequently reviewed and adapted to changing technologies, requirements and constraints. Therefore, CEDENEC believes that the best planning strategies under a high level of uncertainty and risk are no longer those that deliver optimum results in the very specific circumstances anticipated, but those that are robust enough to perform acceptably in a variety of potential scenarios. As such a strategic framework to answer the what-for, the what, the how and the when of the undertaking should be and should allow a balance among stability and flexibility.</p>
                              <p>117. The Spanish NEC Strategic Framework is under CEDENEC's development and covers what Spain must achieve in order to fulfil the operational requirements; Lays down the strategic lines of work including those related with conceptual development, methodology and best practices, design and implementation and shared awareness; Establishes the global plans which include the strategic lines of work and; Goes into details as to short term plans. As it is to be the case for any rolling strategy, operational and technical analysis and studies (including those lessons learned) are to be continuously improving upon this strategic framework. Last but not least in importance is the human dimension including morale, leadership, training, education and, doctrine. The strategic framework is also aimed to this aspects.</p>
                              <p>118. This strategic framework is to be considered within the Spanish Military Planning Process as well as within those efforts made of Defence bodies having technical responsibilities, research and development competences along with acquisitions responsibilities. In this situation the efforts towards the rolling orientation of running capabilities, programs and initiatives are going to be more important than ever.</p>

                              <p>119. It is more important than ever to keep alive the operational and technical interoperability awareness that Spain has held essential for so many years and backed by her participating in different demonstrations, exercises and experiments.</p>
                              <p>120. It is to note Spanish technical experimentation at CWID initiatives. Spanish industry, universities and military bodies with technical competences play a part in the CWID demonstration. A Pilot model for SOA interoperability services, the Spanish Military Messaging System, Spanish web map services and web feature services or COP services have been put to work within latest NATO CWID. As it happened to be within other nations, Spain has its own national CWID. As such, middleware for sensors at C2 networks, or broad band mobile communications for tactical deployments, or tactical mini terminals for satellite band X communications have also been given demonstration airings.</p>
                              <p>121. Spain is also working on supporting infrastructures for experimentation, training and exercises. Noteworthy here is that Spain is working towards the setting up of a Laboratory for NEC experiments (CENEC) where any practical solutions put forward are to be measured against those operative demands. Advanced joint simulation facilities are to be keep financed next year. NEC related prototypes have been delivered to our Operational Post Command.</p>
                              <p>122. Following the NATO approach the development of our systems is in keeping with NC3TAv7 and NAFv2. Spain is analyzing  its architectures views evolution in keeping with NAFv3 and NISP.</p>

                              <p>123. The main effort within the short to medium term must be towards achieving the Spanish NEC strategy for the managing of this complex endeavour and its concomitant experimental support demands.</p>
                              <p>124. In the medium to long term Spain expects to be able to have the run of a fully operative working whole structure, this taking into its scope civilian organizations and other ministries.</p>
                              <p>125. If there were something that could be called an international net-ready certification Spain could be deeply involved in it. Systems processes, capabilities and even acquisitions programmes could be verified on the basis of net-ready criteria or, to put it in another way: systems, processes, capabilities and acquisition programmes associated with network enabled capabilities could have what it might be call a "net-ready stamping". An interoperability authenticity stamp which would be, but of course, anchored upon the international determination it is concerned with. Which all means that an evaluation of existing systems will be called for to check out whether the net-ready criteria have been satisfied be it nationally or within any given coalition.</p>
                              <p>126. The Spanish acquisition process is aligned with NATO Phased Armaments Programming System (PAPS). This process came up for review under a new proposal.  Among other aspects, it's under consideration a set of criteria that allows PAPS documents go further in the process, in order to enable rationalization as well as the necessary evolution in aspects such as technology.</p>
                              <p>127. Spain's ultimate vision is of a real federation of military and civilian services and its cross utilization for crisis management and current operations. Civilian and military bodies would natuarally provide any that were to be needed, services that would thus endow us with powerful dual capabilities for defence and security.</p>

                           <p>128. In order to solve the interoperability and information flow problems caused by a fragmentary approach, the solution adopted is to define and implement a new C2 system, the SMCM (Joint C2 system),  which will become the basic CIS infrastructure on which the specific services will be built. Of course this new system integrates the military telecommunications that have been integrated in a single joint system for many years (the Military Telecomunication System - STM) and is designed from the beginning to solve the shortfalls and problems of the existing information capabilities.</p>
                           <p>129. Its Military Information System (SIM) incremental process has been divided into 3 increments and a previous definition phase. In this definition phase, it has been developed and approved the Concept of Operation of the System, the System Planning and Funding. The first increment objective is to implement and provide a set of common services, like both PKI and Directory Services and the priority services like Military  Messaging System. The system is to be deployed in the principal nodes (Joint, Land, Air and Maritime Headquarters, etc.) and is to be accredited to manage information upon National SECRET, NATO CONFIDENTIAL and CONFIDENTIAL UE level. The second increment includes the implementation of the specific functional services, the accreditation to NATO SECRET and SECRET UE, and it is planned to deploy the system to 400 nodes approximately. The last increment it is planned to provide all the functional area services and evolve the system to comply with the Network Enabled Capability. Of course, our will to set up this increments as schedule is tied to the available budgeting and funding.</p>

                           <p>132. The Swedish Armed Forces has adopted the concept of Network
        Based Defence (NBD) as its main strategy to achieve Network Ready
        Capabilities. NBD is also the method for Swedish force transformation
        to Joint Operations and Capabilities and thus a fast, flexible and
        co-ordinated deployment of Reaction Force Units within national
        boundaries as well as a partner in an international mission. The NBD
        concept is the Swedish approach to retain the benefit of the
        Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) and is similar to the Network
        Enabled Capabilities (NEC) and the Net-Centric Operations Warfare
        (NCOW) concepts.</p>

                           <p>133. The Swedish Armed Forces has within the concept of NBD since
        2001 been developing frameworks, concepts, principles, rules and
        recommendations, as enablers and guidance for design, construction and
        operation of the methods, services and technology solutions that
        should form the foundations and infrastructure of a future Command and
        Control System. The goal is to deploy the target architecture and
        infrastructure of the C2-system within the year of 2010. The C2-system
        is being developed with interoperability and the usage of open
        standards and commercial products (COTS) in focus. Gradually the
        C2-system infrastructure will develop into a full-featured Net-centric
        C4ISTAR-system with incorporated functionality for other legacy
        systems as well as new systems.</p>
                           <p>134. The Swedish Armed Forces has during 2006 established a NBD
        Development Centre under the command of Chief of Development.</p>

        (CD&amp;E) process based on international examples. One of the

        Forces, the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV), the Swedish
        Defence Research Agency (FOI), the National Defence College (FHS), the
        industry and other partners. The development is based on an
        overarching architecture approach with concepts and principles for
        System, Services, Information and Life-Cycle management. The
        development strategy is to use an evolutionary development methodology
        with continuous and parallel research and development of methods,
        knowledge, organisation and technology. The results are tested,
        verified and validated in experiments and demonstrators, and then
        carefully packaged in form of generic principles, design rules and
        methods. These will gradually build up the target architecture with
        re-usable foundations and reference architectures for further
        development of service-oriented systems and components for net-centric
        environments. The Swedish Armed Forces development of the NBD joint
        Command and Control Information System (SWECCIS) results in the
        knowledge and erudition of building NBD operational systems.</p>

        development. Swedish Armed Forces needs to co-ordinate and synchronise
        different resources (personnel, technology and information) enabling
        them to perform right activity, in right time frame and in right area.
        These resources are co-ordinated and synchronised within an
        organisation. To synchronise all these mutual dependent systems and
        their development over time is the complex challenge that Swedish
        Armed Forces Enterprise Architecture shall support Swedish Armed
        Forces to master. The purpose of FMA is to obtain tools for enabling
        interoperability in co-operation with society in general and
        international co-operation partners as well. Another important aspect
        is to give conditions for re-use of resources within the frame of NBD.
        SAF engagement systems must therefore be developed against a
        harmonisation and towards one common structure of present and new
        structures. This development shall be supported through supplying an
        Architecture Framework (FM AR) containing overarching rules

                        <p>155. The UK has adopted the term Network Enabled Capability (NEC) as it
      captures it's intent to invest in networks as a means of maximizing the
      capability inherent in current and future platforms. The UK is using the
      term "Network Enabled Capability" since it gives due weight to both the
      platform capability and the network, and is consonant with their work on
      Effects Based Operations, Knowledge superiority and Decision
      Superiority.</p>
                        <p>156. The NEC goal is to radically enhance our operational capability by
      improving the way we share and use information , with the key objective
      of providing a coherent conceptual and technical framework to link
      sensors, decision-makers and effectors.</p>
                        <p>157. The US concept of Network Centric Warfare, put into practice in
      Afghanistan, is a key driver. In the same way that precision guided
      munitions demonstrated in the Gulf war acted as a driver for change in
      UK and other forces, the success of the US' strategy, implement through
      a tight linkage between sensors, communications, information, and
      weapons systems is causing the UK to look at how it would fight the next
      conflict.</p>
                        <p>158. Lessons learned have emphasized the importance of interoperability
      in the joint and coalition environment.</p>
                        <p>159. It is important to understand that the path to NEC is an
      evolutionary one that builds on existing equipment programmes, concepts
      and structures but delivers increased joint capability. The parallel
      evolution of the other UK Lines development (Concept &amp; Doctrine,
      Structure, Equipment &amp; Technology, People, Training, Sustainment) is
      an essential part of the progress towards a full Defence capability
      Existing processes will provide the links.</p>

                           <p>163. The United States' Department of Defense (DOD) pioneering theory
        of Net-Centric Operations and Warfare (NCOW) has fundamentally changed
        how the United States plans for and engages in military operations.
        NCOW seeks to translate an information advantage into a competitive
        war-fighting advantage through the robust networking of well informed
        geographically dispersed forces allowing new forms of organizational
        behavior. This "networking" utilizes information technology via a
        robust network to allow increased information sharing, collaboration,
        and shared situational awareness, which theoretically allows greater
        self-synchronization, speed of command, and mission
        effectiveness.</p>

                              <p>164. The Global Information Grid Bandwidth Expansion (GIG-BE)
          Program was a major Department of Defense (DOD) net-centric
          transformational initiative executed by DISA. GIG-BE created a
          ubiquitous "bandwidth-available" environment to improve national
          security intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, information
          assurance, as well as command and control. Through GIG-BE, DISA
          leveraged DOD's existing end-to-end information transport
          capabilities, significantly expanding capacity and reliability to
          locations worldwide.</p>
                              <p>165. This program provided increased bandwidth and diverse physical
          access to approximately 87 critical sites in the continental United
          States (CONUS), Pacific Theater, and European Theater. These
          locations are interconnected via an expanded GIG core.</p>
                              <p>166. GIG-BE provides a secure, robust, optical terrestrial network
          that delivers very high-speed classified and unclassified Internet
          Protocol (IP) services to key operating locations worldwide.</p>
                              <p>167. After extensive component integration and operational testing,
          implementation began in the middle of the 2004 fiscal year and
          extended through calendar year 2005. The initial implementation
          concentrated on six sites used during the proof of initial
          operational capability, achieved on Sept. 30, 2004. On Dec. 20,
          2005, the GIG-BE program achieved the milestone of Full Operational
          Capability.</p>

          (TSAT)</h5>
                                    </div>

                              <p>168. The TSAT Program is actually just one node in a broad spectrum
          of programs known as the Transformational Communications
          Architecture (TCA). In 2001, the United States Department of Defense
          (DOD) initiated a Transformational Communications Study to
          accelerate the delivery of advanced capabilities with state-of-the
          art technology to the field.</p>
                              <p>169. The study concluded that the United States Military's existing
          program plan would not meet forecast communications requirements. It
          also suggested that there was a window of opportunity to provide an
          architectural framework for a compatible communications system
          across the Department of Defense and the intelligence community -
          one that could increase U.S. capabilities by a factor of ten.</p>
                              <p>170. Those conclusions, plus ongoing experience in the Global War
          on Terror and new technology developments like UAVs, helped shape
          the Transformational Communications Architecture (TCA).</p>
                              <p>171. TSAT is intended to provide internet-like capability that
          extends high-bandwidth satellite capabilities to deployed troops
          worldwide, and delivers an order of magnitude increase in available
          military bandwidth. Using laser communications inter-satellite links
          to create a high data-rate backbone in space, TSAT will be one of
          the key enablers for the American vision of Network Centric
          Warfare.</p>
                              <p>172. A visual image from a UAV that would take 2 minutes to process
          with the Milstar II satellite system would take less than a second
          with TSAT. A radar image from a Global Hawk UAV (12 minutes), or a
          multi-gigabyte radar image from space-based radar (88 minutes),
          would also take less than a second with the TSAT network. Best of
          all, the recipient can be on the move with a relatively small
          receiver, anywhere in the world.</p>
                              <p>173. The TSAT system is currently scheduled to launch in
          2013-2016.</p>

                              <p>174. Wide-Band Satellite communications provides ubiquitous
          communications with optical quality bandwidth to mobile and tactical
          users.</p>
                              <p>175. The Wideband Gapfiller Satellite program and the Advanced
          Wideband System will augment and eventually replace the Defense
          Satellite Communications System (DSCS) in 2009 or 2010. These
          satellites will transmit several gigabits of data per second-up to
          ten times the data flow of the satellites being replaced.</p>
                              <p>176. Protected communications will be addressed by a global
          extremely high frequency (EHF) system, composed of the Advanced
          Extremely High Frequency System and Advanced Polar System. These
          systems are expected to provide about ten times the capacity of
          current protected satellites (the Milstar satellites). Narrowband
          needs are supported by the UFO (Ultrahigh-frequency Follow-On)
          constellation, which will be replaced by a component of the Advanced
          Narrowband System.</p>
                              <p>177. Capacity gains in these systems will also be matched by
          improved features, such as multiple high-gain spot beams that are
          particularly important for small terminal and mobile users.
          Satellite, terminal, control, and planning segments will utilize
          emerging technology to ensure the best capability for the cost.
          Coordination among ground, air, and space segments and between
          government and commercial assets will help ensure deployment of the
          most efficient, effective, and affordable communications
          systems.</p>

          applications and content needed to provide analysts and war fighters
          with the ability to make sense of complex and ambiguous situations.
          Within HF, the first implementation of a Service Oriented
          Architecture (SOA) in the Department of Defense was achieved. The
