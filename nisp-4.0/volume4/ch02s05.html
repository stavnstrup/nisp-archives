                     <p>91. It seems that no matter how advanced notebook computers get, their
      battery life remains at a standstill: 2-3 hours from most models,
      regardless of price. From electric vehicles to portable electronics,
      today's battery capacity lags far behind the steady improvements in
      other areas of technology. Despite the hype and advertising from battery
      manufacturers, today's chemical batteries are virtually identical to
      ones sold three decades ago.</p>
                     <p>92. It's not that battery manufacturers aren't trying to develop
      something better: efforts to improve battery capacity and power density
      have been underway for years. Despite the research, arguably the best
      technology they have produced yet is the ingenious battery testing strip
      that you can use to check how quickly your batteries have gone
      dead.</p>
                     <p>93. Today's battery technology is simply outdated. The chemicals are
      extremely hazardous to the environment (Nickel-Cadmium, for example, is
      made from two heavy metals that are toxic to practically all forms of
      life on the planet), dangerous to nearby users (risk of explosions),
      heavy (standard car batteries can weigh 70+ pounds) and unreliable. They
      charge slowly, their output voltage wavers, and their size becomes a
      major limiting factor when designing portable electronics like digital
      cameras.</p>
                     <p>94. Portable power is a crucial enabling technology for a vast array
      of applications. Some of these applications include:</p>

          don't deliver the horsepower. AIBO, Sony's robotic pet, only barks

          total electric vehicles have not succeeded in military applications
          primarily due to their lack of range (power density). That's the
          fault of the battery technology: it requires a thousand pounds of
          batteries to drive a vehicle the same distance delivered by four
          gallons of gasoline. While hybrid vehicles are finding tremendous
          success in the marketplace by packing both batteries and combustion
          engines under the same hood, tomorrow's vehicles could run off

          exploration. Battery requirements shape the scope of entire

                                 </span> - Solar
          power is clean, renewable, safe, reliable and environmentally
          friendly. Unfortunately, it's expensive to install, and the single
          greatest cost often comes from the batteries, not the solar panels.
          Batteries for solar systems are typically large, heavy, dangerous
          (risk of explosions), expensive and short-lived (many need replacing
          in a mere five years). A breakthrough in power density and storage
          costs could revolutionize the solar industry, making residential and
          commercial solar systems far more affordable. If battery costs could
          be halved, it would subtract five years from the average twenty-year
          return on solar systems.</p>

                     <p>95. These are just a few of the many important applications of high
      density portable power. Remember, though, it's not just the density that
      matters: it's the cost as well. To herald a genuine breakthrough, the
      next wave of technology needs to be better on all counts: size, weight
      and cost.</p>

                        <p>96. The most promising candidate technology that meets this
        requirement is fuel cell technology. Fuel cells are clean, small and
        lightweight, and will eventually be cheap to produce. The choice of
        fuels for those fuel cells, however, remains undecided.</p>
                        <p>97. One of the promising contenders is zinc -- one of the most
        abundant minerals in the planet. With the help of fuel cell membranes,
        zinc particles release electricity when oxidized by exposing them to
        air. Once all the zinc is oxidized, the zinc particles can be quickly
        ''recharged" (reversing the oxidation process with the help of
        electricity) and used again. This process can be endlessly repeated,
        since the zinc never wears out.</p>
                        <p>98. Zinc is promising because it offers high density portable power
        (far greater power density than chemical batteries), a
        widely-available element, and outstanding safety (zinc won't explode
        if exposed to flames or high temperatures). The industry leader in
        portable zinc power is Metallic Power

                        <p>99. Zinc power isn't seeing many headlines these days. Much of the
        news about portable fuel cells seems focused on methanol. These
        so-called Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs) convert methanol (a
        common alcohol that can be derived from corn, among other renewable
        sources) into electricity. NEC, Samsung, and already have working
        prototypes of DMFCs for notebook computers or portable
        electronics.</p>
                        <p>100. The problem with methanol is its combustibility: methanol
        ignites easily and has a flash point ranging from room temperature to
        130 degrees (F), depending on the concentration of water in the
        mixture. That makes it an illegal explosive according to the laws of
        many countries, meaning that DMFCs would not be allowed on airplanes
        unless existing regulations are changed.</p>
                        <p>101. Methanol also has the drawback of not being easily renewed by
        consumers. Few people have the know-how to distill methanol in their
        own garage, meaning that consumers would be dependent on DMFC
        manufacturers for methanol recharge kits. Like ink jet printer refill
        kits, this is where DMFC manufacturers will probably make the bulk of
        their profits.</p>

        the widespread adoption of a fuel cell battery standard. Today's
        chemical batteries are holding back promising applications for
        emerging technologies, and only a breakthrough in portable power can
        overcome those limitations. Fuel cells can make the leap, and their
        adoption by consumers and manufacturers alike is all but
        assured.</p>

                              <strong>Importance:</strong>
                           </span> Fuel cells are very
        useful as power sources and offer significant savings of loads, in
        weight and volume, compared to conventional power sources. Because
        fuel cells have no moving parts and do not involve combustion, in
        ideal conditions they can achieve up to 99.9999% reliability. This
        equates to less than one minute of down time in a six year
        period.</p>
