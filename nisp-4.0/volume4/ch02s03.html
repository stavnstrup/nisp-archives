                        <p>32. For decades, the size of silicon-based transistors has decreased
        steadily while their performance has improved. As the devices approach
        their physical limits, though, researchers have started looking to
        less conventional structures and materials. Single-walled carbon
        nanotubes are one prominent candidate -- already researchers have
        built carbon nanotube transistors that show promising performance.
        According to estimates, carbon nanotubes have the potential to produce
        transistors that run 10 times faster than even anticipated future
        generations of silicon-based devices, while at the same time using
        less power.</p>

                        <p>35. Most flexible electronics, such as those used in e-paper and
        roll-up displays for mobile devices, rely on transistors made of
        either organic polymers, printed directly on a plastic substrate, or
        amorphous, or noncrystalline, silicon. However, transistors made of
        these materials can't perform at the gigahertz speeds needed for
        complex circuitry or antennas.</p>
                        <p>36. People have for some time been able to make slow flexible
        electronics, but the speed of the transistors has been limited. The
        next step has been to make the transistors out of high-quality,
        single-crystal silicon instead of organic polymers and amorphous
        silicon because electrons simply move faster in single-crystal
        silicon.</p>

                        <p>39. Optical fibers can quickly transmit huge amounts of data. But
        the technology for sorting and sending photons lags far behind the
        microelectronics that generates and process the data, putting a crimp
        on bandwidths. In the past few years, scientists and engineers have
        made great strides in miniaturizing photonic devices and integrating
        them onto a single chip. Such advances allow for cheaper
        manufacturing, smaller sizes, and higher performance. Along the way
        they've developed techniques for working with materials common to the
        semiconductor industry, which is a step toward integrating photonics
        and electronics on the same chip. And these researchers have made
        structures with phenomenal precision, in some cases down to distances
        smaller than those that separate atoms.</p>
                        <p>40. Even with these successes, however, a major obstacle remained.
        Light delivered via cylindrical fiber optics breaks into different
        polarizations, or orientations of light waves. In devices at the
        microscale, the outputs change depending on if the waves are oriented
        vertically or horizontally so they're suited to processing only
        certain polarizations, which can lead to weakened signals. If
        researchers are limited to using horizontally polarized light, for
        example, they end up throwing away vertically polarized light and lose
        half the signal strength. That's a problem particularly when sending
        signals over long distances, such as between continents.</p>
                        <p>41. One approach to this problem is to run light through more than
        one device, each specifically designed to process one polarization.
        Researchers at MIT's Research Laboratory of Electronics took a
        different approach. Rather than building separate devices for
        different light polarizations, they invented a device for converting
        vertically polarized light into horizontally polarized light. First,
        the device splits light into its horizontally and vertically polarized
        components, directing these into separate channels. Then it gradually
        rotates the vertically polarized light to make it horizontal. At this
        point, the light in both channels has the same polarization. This
        makes it possible to use identical devices to process that light. As a
        result, all of the light is processed in the same way, allowing clear,
        strong signals.</p>
                        <p>42. The current advance pertains only to those photonic applications
        that involve light with multiple polarizations and those
        communications applications that involve fiber optics. There hasn't
        been much economic pressure in the past couple of years to develop
        technology for these applications because of a glut in bandwidth, but
        now communications demands are increasing again.</p>

                        <p>45. Researchers have fabricated high ­performance, transparent
        thin-film transistors (TFTs) using a low-cost, low-temperature method.
        They use indium oxide as both a semiconductor and a conductor,
        combining the inorganic material with organic insulators on top of a
        transparent substrate. The resulting transistors perform nearly as
        well as the much more expensive polysilicon transistors used to
        control pixels in high-end TVs and computer monitors.</p>
                        <p>46. On glass that's been coated with a transparent electrode, the
        researchers deposit the organic insulating materials, which form a
        multilayered lattice. To deposit the indium oxide, the researchers use
        a standard technique called ion-assisted deposition, in which an ion
        beam controls the crystallization and adhesion of the oxide. Changing
        the oxygen pressure during the process varies the conductivity of the
        indium oxide, which can thus be used as a semiconductor in one part of
        the device and as a conductor in other parts.</p>

                           </span> The new TFTs could
        replace the opaque transistors used to control pixels in digital
        displays. Because the low-temperature method can deposit transistors
        on flexible plastics, it could lead to see-through displays affixed to
        curved surfaces such as windshields and helmet visors. The method is
        also cheap enough, and easy enough to adapt for large-scale
        manufacturing, that it could make such displays affordable. Imagine a
        vehicle windshield that displays a map to your destination, military
        goggles with targets and instructions displayed right before a
        soldier's eyes.</p>

                           </span> Negotiations for
        licensing the technology have begun. Prototype displays could be ready
        within 18 months. The researchers hope to improve the performance of
        the transistors so that they could serve as processors or memory
        cells.</p>
