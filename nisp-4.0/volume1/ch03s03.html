      areas as a management mechanism to organise information about NNEC
      developments in order to facilitate NNEC governance. The four NNEC
      Coherance Areas are:</p>

                     <p>32. The purpose of the OCRI Coherence Area is to improve coherence
      across the operational community of all activities which need to address
      NNEC. The goals of OCRI are to ensure that NNEC principles are addressed
      in all concept development, identify and derive common NNEC service
      requirements from operational concepts and requirements, to provide NNEC
      concepts and technological advances for use by developers of operational
      concepts, doctrine and organisation, to define operational
      interoperability metrics, and to recommend operational
      improvements.</p>
                     <p>33. The purpose of the ASDS Coherence Area is to improve the coherence
      of interoperability standards. The goals of ASDS are to oversee the
      development of a common service-oriented architectural framework and set
      of service definitions based on operational needs, to update these as
      new technologies and operational needs are developed, and to define
      service-based maturity levels.</p>
                     <p>34. The purpose of the Implementation Coherence area is to improve
      NNEC coherence across all capability delivery programs. The goals of
      Implementation are to identify current and future service availability,
      to identify services shortfalls, to perform interoperability evaluation
      and assessment, and make recommendations for changes.</p>
                     <p>35. The purpose of the L &amp; G Coherence Area is to support NNEC
      governance and to ensure overall coherence. The goals of L &amp; G are
      to establish levels of ambition, to establish high level NNEC policies,
      to provide coordination between all four Coherence Areas, and to provide
      widespread awareness of information about NNEC.</p>
                     <p>36. The NOSWG supports the C3CCSC as a coordination body for the ASDS
      by Identifying Standards appropriate for all architectures and profiles
      supporting implementation solutions.</p>
                     <p>37. The Implementation Coherence area also needs to adhere to the
      standards, grouped in profiles that are placed in the NISP as
      'agreements'.</p>
                     <p>38. However the role of coordination bodies for the four Coherence
      Areas will require significant additional staff work. Although it is
      expected that the NATO C3 Representatives (NC3Reps) will become the
      coordination body for Leadership and Guidance (L &amp; G), the
      coordination bodies have not been agreed for the other Coherence Areas.
      Once identified and agreed, each designated coordination body will need
      to determine whether the work can be achieved by reallocating personnel
      from existing tasks or whether there is a need to hire additional
      staff.</p>
                     <p>39. NATO, Nations and industry have all recognized the necessity to
      migrate to a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) based implementation to
      support NNEC. The set of standards and profiles formerly identified in the platform based approach were not adequate to support either the SOA or the NNEC concept. It was therefore a necessity to reorganise and rework the NISP to identify additional standards and profiles to support service specifications. During this rework it came apparent that the NISP needs to support not only a time phased implementation, but also the ongoing work on developing a maturity model to help NATO and Nations to develop roadmaps for NII achievement.</p>
                     <p>40. Partitioning the NISP into timeframes of near, mid and far-term
      was greatly influenced by the NNEC Feasibility Study, NATO Architecture approach,
      national NEC development and industry best practices. One common thread
      through all these efforts is the need to partition NATO CIS
      implementations into well defined time periods in order to transition to
      NII.</p>
                     <p>41. NATO, Nations and industry have adopted a time phased approach
      achieving their respective goals for system implementations. Although
      using different terminologies and time frames, these approaches are
      based on the same concept of mapping of standards and profiles to
      timeframes. The NISP has adopted this approach as a guiding concept for
      its development.</p>
                     <p>42. In addition there is another strong need to develop Roadmaps for
      NNEC implementation. These roadmaps will describe which level of
      maturity that either NATO or the Nation shall achieve at a specific
      point in time. The identified maturity level will point or map to
      specific standards and profiles that are required in order to be
      interoperable and compliant.</p>
                     <p>43. The following sub-sections contain some representative examples of
      the maturity level model and of the time phased approach for specifying
      standards and technologies.</p>

                                 </h3>
                              </div>

                        </div>
                        <p>44. The concept of a NII Maturity Level was one of the two main
        components of the NII Interoperability Framework (NIIF), the other
        component being the Information Interoperability (I-Squared) Index. In
        general terms, the NML supports Programme planning and auditing
        activities across NATO and the nations, while the I-Squared Index will
        be a more detailed technical reference document.</p>
                        <p>45. One of the challenges in implementing an effective NEC involving
        NATO, NATO nations, coalition partners, government agencies, and
        non-government organisations is to ensure a common understanding of
        information infrastructure capabilities including interoperability,
        based on objective criteria. This challenge is particularly difficult
        in an alliance context where there is no overall authority so
        policies, procedures, and standards cannot be directed from a central
        authority. NATO does not have any guaranteed insight into nor any
        responsibilities towards national infrastructure programs. In response
        to this challenge a time-phased NML approach is proposed as a solution
        to ensuring this common understanding.</p>
                        <p>46. The NML approach uses a five-level definition of capabilities
        numbered from 1 to 5, defining increasing levels of capabilities. This
        five level approach provides an intuitive and easily understood
        measurement of a complex capability and is extremely useful for
        effective communications between diverse audiences. It must be noted,
        however, that the NML approach is designed to improve processes and
        not to measure actual physical infrastructure. However the use of a
        five level model with defined information infrastructure capabilities
        for each level with specific objective criteria is a simple and
        powerful approach.</p>
                        <p>47. It should also be noted that this NML approach to NNEC
        capability could be expanded to cover not only the NII but the
        complete spectrum of capabilities, perhaps divided into the Doctrine,
        organisation, Training, Materiel, Leadership and Education, Personnel
        and Facilities (DOTMLPF) categories currently used in assessing a
        force capability. This would provide a more complete model to assess
        the capabilities of a force but was beyond the scope of the NNEC
        Feasibility study.</p>
                        <p>48. A five level model can be related to the overall vision of NNEC
        which defines four levels of mission capability, namely Deconflict,
        Coordinate, Collaborate, and Coherent. A fifth level of capability,
        reflecting a rudimentary capability, called "Stand-Alone" could be
        added, below Deconflict. This would reflect an organisation or
        military unit with little or no capabilities, procedures, nor
        experience in interoperating with other military forces or
        organisations. It is anticipated, (indeed hoped) that there will be
        few forces or organisations that fit into this rudimentary capability
        category.</p>
                        <p>49. The NML presented in the NNEC Feasibility Study Volume II Annex
        G consisted of two major components. The first was the
        time-independent NML itself which was derived directly from the
        overall time-independent NNEC NML developed in Volume 1 of the study
        and is in turn tied into the required NNEC operational capabilities
        expressed as Mission Capability Packages (MCPs). The second component
        was the time-dependent Infrastructure Implementation (I-Squared) Index
        which was derived from the first NML component, but provides
        measurable criteria for use in defining and implementing an NII
        roadmap. Note that full completion of the I-Squared Index including
        validation of the criteria values would take considerable effort and
        was not within the scope of the NNEC Feasibility study.</p>
