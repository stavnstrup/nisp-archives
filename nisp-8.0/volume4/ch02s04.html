               <p>209. SOA offers a mechanism for achieving the agility required for NNEC.
                  Whereas the current stove-piped way of doing business is rigid and
                  difficult to adapt because business functions and the supporting IT are so
                  tightly coupled, an SOA exploits newly available software components and
                  web standards that can be reconfigured easily and quickly. SOA translates
                  capabilities, processes and functions into services which can be invoked
                  by a user through an interface. This requires the services to be available
                  and the user to know the "what, how, how much and when" of
                  accessing them. How the services work is of no consequence to the user but
                  is important to designers and architects. The underlying principles are
                      not new, but the web services and related technology to bring it to life
                      are; reinforced by their wide acceptance.
               </p>
               <p>210. The predominant precept is that SOA is business driven. This puts
                      designated defence Process Owners in the driving seat because they place
                      requirements for service provision. If SOA is to be successful it means
                      that they must truly understand what drives the capability they are
                      entrusted to deliver so that they are in a position to inform/drive how it
                      can be delivered to users in the most effective and efficient manner
                      possible. New technology enables much looser coupling between business
                      processes and the IT systems which support them and so overcome one of the
                      key drivers of cost in most IT deployments - tight coupling i.e.
                      changes in one area requiring a cascade of other required changes in order
                      to work; with familiar cost, time and performance penalties. To support
                      this, a high level governance structure is essential to enforce data and
                      quality of service standards which enable reuse of services.
               </p>
               <p>211. There are many benefits to SOA. They include access to previously
                      unavailable information, the design of reusable services, the ability to
                      make up new services from existing ones, the ability for businesses to
                      make changes without costly IT expenditure, and so on. Moreover, the
                      issues subtending from the use of legacy systems and the requirement to
                      leverage as much value for money as possible from their continued use,
                      becomes much less difficult by adopting a service perspective. For those
                      who embrace SOA and see it through, the prospect of a working NNEC becomes
                      realisable for the first time.
               </p>
               <p>212. SOA is already here and any new major system provided by any one of
                      the leading industry vendors is likely to have an SOA capability embedded
                      in it. However, it should be noted that the federated model of SOA
                      described in this design rule is still an emerging concept which will take
                      time to reach maturity.
