                           and a provider for recurring services.
                  </p>
                  <p>132. The aim is to provide transparency on control options for the consumer 
                           and the provider by describing exactly assured performance characteristics 
                           like amount of effort, reaction time, and speed of processing. Its main part 
                           is the description of the quality of the service (service level) that has been
                           agreed.

                  <p>133. The Service-Registry / -Repository ensures that services are being found
                           and executed and be deposited them through a service-bus.
                  </p>
                  <p>134. If, for example a function is initiated on the application frontend that
                           requires a service, the service-bus performs the necessary steps for connection. 
                           For that purpose the service-bus accesses the service-registry / repository and 
                           connects the right service (provider) with the right service client (consumer).
                           
                  </p>
                  <p>135. In summary, the function of a service-bus encompasses transmission, data
                           transformation and routing of a message.
                  </p>
                  <p>136. Beside its main task &#8211; to enable communication amongst the SOA-participants
                           &#8211; the service-bus is also responsible for the technical service. This comprises 
                           logging, security, message transformation and the administration of transactions.

                                 Application Integration (EAI)</strong></span></p>
                  <p>138. The concept of the service-bus guarantees a main advantage for the SOA-model
                           against the classic EAI (Enterprise Application Integration). The EAI-approach
                           uses a software bus, in order to connect two applications with the same technology
                           whilst the service bus of a SOA offers a lot more flexibility because of its
                           technological independence and the orientation of the services. The service 
                           bus supplements the EAI concept and so eliminates its weak points. These weak 
                           points are particularly its dependence on proprietary APIs, its uneven development
                           behavior and manufacturer-dependant message formats.
                  </p>
                  <p>139. Here the fundamental difference between a SOA and EAI becomes obvious.
                           An EAI is focused on the coupling of autonomous applications in order to achieve 
                           useful possibilities for data processing of the overall application. In a SOA 
                           services are coupled only loosely and existing systems shall remain untouched whenever possible. Specifically, in a
                     SOA the services are in focus, not 
                           the application systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>140. Another advantage of SOA vs. EAI is the scalability of the service-bus.
                           The EAI-concept is based on the "Hub-and-Spoke Method", where the software bus
                           as a central point of contact connects the involved enterprise applications.

                           because the business processes of the companies / organizations are very different.
                           
                  </p>
                  <p>143. To achieve comparability, different definitions and groupings of services
                           are considered and a corresponding mapping is made. For that purpose the following
                           definition of a SOA- (ESB)-infrastructure is used:

                  <p>144. A basic principle of SOA &#8211; Service Oriented Architecture &#8211; is a loose 
                           coupling of (web) services of operational systems, of different development 
                           languages and other technologies with underlaid applications. SOA separates
                           functions in different services that can be accessed, combined and reused 
                           via a network.

                  <p>145. The use of an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB), also named Enterprise Integration 
                           Bus, as a central component is meaningful for the connection of services for 
                           more complex, SOA-based solutions. Typically an ESB consists of a set of instruments 
                           for reliable and assured message-transfer, routing-mechanisms for message-distribution,
                           pre-designed adaptors for the integration of different systems, management- and 
                           supervision-tools and other components.

                           Bus (ESB) iaw a virtual bus, that consists of only one component &#8211; ESB-Stub &#8211; ,
                           through which any further component (e.g. provider, consumer) is connected
                           with the virtual bus. Depending on the type of component, either the provider,
                           through the ESB-stub, provides a service-endpoint or a consumer uses a service
                           of a provider trough the ESB-stub, respectively. The communication between
                           consumer and provider is effected through the ESB-stub exclusively, though
                           not via a central unit but directly. In the ESB-context, the infrastructure,
                           like a provider, provides further services, which contain the ESB-stub as well.
                           
                  </p>

                           obtain the service-description or for security and as these services are needed
                           for every single use of a service, the ESB-stub executes these basic services
                           automatically. For that reason the infrastructure in many cases is also being

                           of data, respectively. For that purpose the ESB, through its framework, provides
                           to the consumers open, standardized service-endpoints of providers.

                           (see the following figure).

                           conversion of the message into or from MOM, respectively. The basic idea of MOM
                           is a Multi Protocol Messaging Bus that supports transmission and forwarding of 
                           messages asynchronously while considering QoS (Quality of Service).
                           
                  </p>
                  <p>157. In context with a<span class="bold"><strong>ESB-Stub</strong></span>, that provides
                           an open service-endpoint, the application-server has to be looked at.
                  </p>
                  <p>158. In general an application-server is a server within a computer network, 
                           on which specialized services (application-services) are being executed. In 
                           the strict sense an application-server is software acting as a middleware 
                           representing a runtime environment for application-services. Depending on
                           scaling they are assigned special services like transaction-administration, 
                           authentication or access on databases through defined interfaces.
                  </p>
                  <p>159. The simplest variant of an application-server is an ESB-stub, which,
                           iaw the SOA-mechanisms / -standards provides or integrates one special service
                           whereas application-servers integrate multiple special services (application-services)
                           through an ESB-Stub and, depending on their realization, offer more capabilities 
                           (functions).
                  </p>
                  <p>160. Amongst others, through an ESB-stub / application-server the following
                           functions are available:
                             
                     <div class="itemizedlist">
                        <ul class="itemizedlist">
                           <li class="listitem">
                              <p>start service,</p>
                           </li>
                           <li class="listitem">
                              <p>stop service,</p>
                           </li>
                           <li class="listitem">
                              <p>request status of a service,</p>
                           </li>
                           <li class="listitem">
                              <p>unlock service for use,</p>
                           </li>
                           <li class="listitem">
                              <p>lock/deny service for use.</p>
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </div>
                           
                  </p>
                  <p>161. However the ESB-Stub cannot support the function "star service", because
                           no component is active that can accept and execute the demand for start on
                           a provider that is shut down. This would require an additional agent. The 
                           functions being provided by an ESB-stub / application-server are used for 
                           example by a service management system.
                  </p>
                  <p>162. This gives the following requirements for SRE:

                           the OSI-layers 1 (bit transfer) and 2 (security layer). On the bit-transfer-layer
                           the digital transfer of bits is done on either on a wired or a nonwired transmission
                           line. It is the task of the security layer (also being referred to as: section
                           security layer, data security layer, connectivity security layer, connection
                           layer or procedural layer) to ensure reliable transfer and to manage access

                           3 (Mediation Layer). For circuit-based services the mediation layer (also: 
                           packet-layer or network layer) does the switching of connections and for
                           packet-oriented services it does the external distribution of data packages.
                           The main task of the mediation layer is the built-up and update of routing
                           tables and the fragmentation of data-packages.

                           (receiver). It offers to the application-oriented layers 5 to 7 a standardized 
                           access, so they do not have to consider these features of the communication 
                           network.

                  <p>168. The <span class="bold"><strong>Session Layer</strong></span> corresponds to OSI-layer
                           5 (Communication Control Layer). It provides control of logical connections 
                           and of process communication between two systems. Here we find the protocols 
                           like HTTP, RPC, CORBA (IIOP, ORB), JMS, etc.
                  </p>

                                 Presentation Layer</strong></span>, which is OSI-Layer 6. The presentation layer
                           translates the system-dependant presentation of data into a system-independent
                           presentation and thereby enables the syntactically correct data-exchange between 
                           different systems. Also data-compression and data-encryption is a task of layer
                           6. The presentation layer ensures that data being sent from the application 
                           layer of one system can be read by the application layer of another system. 
                           If necessary the presentation layer acts as a translator between various data 
                           formats by using a data format that is under-stood by both systems.

                           that is based on the functions of OSI layer 5 and enables access or provision
                           of data for the applications (<span class="bold"><strong>consumer, provider</strong></span>)

                           needed expansions of UDDI and is still under further development. However, 
                           ebXML is not yet available in many products.

                                 </strong></span>&#8211; a W3C-recommendation. SOAP is a &#8220;lightweight&#8221; protocol for the 
                           exchange of XML-based messages on a computer network. It establishes rules 
                           for message design. It regulates how data has to be represented in a message
                           and how it has to be interpreted. Further on it provides a convention for 
                           remote call-up of procedures by using messages.
                  </p>
                  <p>176. SOAP makes no rules on semantics of application-specific data that shall
                           be sent but provides a framework which enables the transmission of any application-specific
                           information.
                  </p>
                  <p>177. SOAP is used for the remote call-up of procedures as well as for simple 
                           message systems or for data exchange. For the transmission of messages any 
                           protocols (OSI-Layer 5) such as FTP, SMTP, HTTP or JMS can be used.

                  <p>178. A loose coupling &#8211; a basic SOA principle &#8211; is a principle and not a tool.
                           When designing a SOA envi-ronment the amount of loose couplings to be established
                           has to be determined.
                  </p>
                  <p>179. Communication with an addressable communication partner can be effected
                           in two ways:

                                                   </strong></span>environment the communication partner has to be dialed before
                                             information exchange actually starts and so a communication path between 
                                             the two endpoints evolved is established through the net (a connection).
                                             Only then data can be exchanged (the data will always use the very same
                                             path through the net). When data exchange is terminated, the communication 
                                             path is shut down. In general the address of the communication partner
                                             is only needed for the connection-built-up; then the net &#8222;remembers&#8220;, as 
                                             well as the endpoints, which connection connects which endpoints.

                                             before data exchange nor a shutdown thereafter must be executed. From
                                             the net perspective there is no established communication relation between
                                             two endpoints. Consequently there is no pre-determination of the path 
                                             through the net during connection build-up. Instead each piece of information
                                             is addressed individually to the recipient and forwarded to the recipient
                                             by all other pieces of information based on this address in the net. All
                                             nodes in the net &#8220;know&#8221; on which paths to reach a certain destination.
                                             If there is more than one path from the sender to the recipient, different
                                             pieces of information may use different paths through the net.

                  <p>180. From the communication technology-perspective the main difference is 
                           that in contrary to a connectivity-oriented communication no status information 
                           for each connection has to be stored in the connectionless communication environment. 
                           Two conclusions can be drawn from that:

                                             via this node are terminated; in connectionless communications the pieces
                                             of information are simply routed around the failing node and communication

                           environment for services (SRE):

                                             the service-management portion of SRE must identify the communication

                  <p>183. alMiddleware can be distinguished by the basic technology it uses: Data
                           Oriented Middleware, Remote Procedure Call, Transaction Oriented Middleware,
                           Message Oriented Middleware and Component Oriented Middleware.
                  </p>
                  <p>184. The most common basic technology is the Message Oriented Middleware.
                           It will be applied further on in the SRE. Here information exchange is realized
                           with messages being transported by the middleware from one application to the
                           next, starting from the ESB-stub. If necessary, message queues will be used.
                           
                  </p>
                  <p>185. Based on the communication methods Message Oriented Middleware may apply
                           different message-exchange-patterns. The message-exchange-patterns differ in:

                                             In this pattern the user sends a request to the service-provider and 
                                             waits for a response. The components involved interact synchronously
                                             (and in most cases block each other!). The reaction follows immediately
                                             on the exchanged information. This pattern is mostly used by real-time-systems.
                                             In order to prevent an application blockade, the response can be awaited 
                                             asynchronously. Therefore, in general synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous 
                                             (non-blocking) Request / Response can be distinguished, where the asynchronous
                                             (non-blocking) Request / Response represents a kind of Request / Callback
                                             Pattern.

                                             If no response or confirmation is needed for a service call-up, then 
                                             there is a simpler pattern as the request/response pattern. In One-Way-Notification
                                             a message is just sent (&#8222;fire and forget&#8220;). An error message is then a
                                             for example a One-Way-Notification.

                                             Often a consumer needs data or a feed-back without being blocked until
                                             it is received. This pattern is referred to as non-blocking or asynchronous 
                                             Request / Response or Request / Callback, respectively. Here the consumer
                                             sends a request without blocking. I.e., a response is received when it
                                             is present or, if there is no response an autonomous response is sent, 
                                             respectively. This higher flexibility however causes a higher amount 
                                             of effort, because the application itself must ensure proper handling
                                             of asynchronous responses.

                                             In this pattern a user registers with a consumer for specific notifications 
                                             or events. This pattern allows several consumers to subscribe. For specific

                                             this. The later distribution of events or state changes is realized using

                           (ESB-Stub) of the refer-ence environment for services (SRE) can be derived:

                                             Request / Callback (asynchronous Request / Response), One-Way-Notification
                                             and Publish / Subscribe.

                  <p>187. A message-exchange-pattern always depends on the characteristics of the
                           related transport layer or the used protocol, respectively. Things may look
                           different one layer above or below. Asynchronous message-exchange-patterns 
                           can be implemented on synchronous protocols and vice versa.

                           API may provide a virtually reliable message exchange. (This however may cause
                           the disadvantage of undesired additional delay having great influence on the
                           availability and QoS of that service). If, for instance, a consumer sends a
                           request and is then blocked and the request gets lost so that the consumer
                           would not be informed about it, then API could send a second request some time
                           later (see above figure).

                  <p>189. From the SOA perspective two things are important: Which Message-Exchange-Patterns
                           support the underlaid protocol and which Message-Exchange-Patterns eventually
                           support an API.
                  </p>
                  <p>190. If the ESB is protocol-driven, most likely the application is responsible
                           to embody a corresponding mechanisms of an API. If the ESB is API-driven, it 
                           is the responsibility of the ESB to support corresponding mechanisms.

                  <p>191. Beyond the facts described above there are further complex requirements. 
                           For example they result from the situation, that an application performs a 
                           retry because it didn&#8216;t get a response within time-out. In this case the application
                           might just have assumed a lost response. After the retry the application then
                           gets two responses. It could also happen that two requests (orders) had been
                           sent. This could result in a double debit entry on a bank account instead of 
                           only one &#8211; as was desired.

                           &#8211; a cross-domain service use is necessary.

                  <p>193. With a cross-domain service use, it is important to note that Bundeswehr
                           assignments in SRE should be carried out in the Joint and Combined environment.
                           This means that cross-domain service use does not only occur within its own 
                           (national) technical domain but also within technical domains of external partners
                           (e.g. NATO partners).

                  <p>195. A cross-domain use of services calls for an interoperability of the

                           in accordance with the domain concept. The cross-domain service use on technical
                           domains is based upon open standardized service end-points.
                  </p>
                  <p>198. If a provider makes an open standardized service end point available in 
                           a technical domain, the ser-vice end point can be used by a consumer of the
                           same domain, as well as by a consumer of a differ-ent technical domain.
                  </p>
                  <p>199. In the following figure, the basic principle of the use of open, standardized
                           service endpoints is depicted.

                           description) in order to be able to use a service. The consumer typically
                           receives such information from their own SOA (ESB) Infrastructure. In doing
                           so, the SOA (ESB) Infrastructure of the technical domains to which the consumer
                           is assigned, requires this information for a cross-domain service use.
                  </p>
                  <p>201. So as to reduce interoperability problems and to guarantee self-sufficient
                           consumer / provider configurations in a technical domain, the consumer and 
                           provider are assigned to a technical domain and for all infrastructure requirements,
                           use the SOA (ESB) Infrastructure of the technical domains.

                           to use a service beyond technical domain borders, this information must first 
                           be entered into the technical domain of the consumer.

                  <p>203. To this end, a synchronization mechanism between the technical domains
                           is provided through, which the relevant data for service use on technical

                           the information (service description and policies) from the respective technical
                           domains (SOA (ESB) Infrastructure), an exchange of this information would take 
                           place per consumer across domain borders. With targeted synchronization, the
                           information exchange (service descriptions and policies) across domain borders
                           would be restricted to a single exchange.
                  </p>
                  <p>205. In summary, service use across technical domains occurs by means of an
                           open, standardized service end-point and the synchronization of information 
                           (service description and policies).
                  </p>
                  <p>206. Information domains are, as previously mentioned, user-specific domains
                           which from an ESB perspective, are virtual and placed over technical domains.
                           Generally speaking, a consumer or a provider can only be assigned to one technical
                           domain. However, a provider can belong to several different information domains
                           whereby consumers can use providers from different information domains.
                  </p>
                  <p>207. The information domains are defined, among others, by authorization 
                           (policies) which are to be drawn up for services using the service description. 
                           The type of the authorization (policies) for a service can therefore vary greatly.
                           For example, the authorization regulations may be composed of:

                           since the information necessary for a cross-domain service use is provided 
                           to the consumer via the SOA (ESB) Infrastructure in which this is statically

                           be relatively high. Furthermore, own technical domains in the respective nations
                           will exist with cross-nations service use and supply.
                  </p>
                  <p>211. So that a consumer can get the information he requires from his local
                           technical domain in order to gain access to a service beyond national or international
                           domain borders, this must first be entered into the local technical domain of 
                           the service. For this reason, a synchronization mechanism between the technical
                           domains is necessary via which the relevant data for the use of a service is 
                           distributed .

                  <p>212. The following figure depicts the starting point of two technical domains 
                           which have no physical connection to one another. Both technical domains are
                           self-sufficient and have consumer, provider and an SOA (ESB) Infrastructure
                           which provides the consumers in the domains with information regarding the use
                           of the locally assigned provider.

                           service of the respective domain must detect a new / additional technical 
                           domain and send a trigger to the SOA (ESB) Infrastructure service for synchronization.

                           (see the following figure). Therefore, each domain only publishes local services
                           that are provided via these domain borders. The synchronization service must
                           thus take into account the underlying QoS parameters and policies. Using a
                           corresponding service classification, the services for which a cross-domain 
                           use is permitted are determined and published.

                  <p>218. The synchronizations mechanism is independent from the equipment / provision
                           of the technical domains. This means, for example, that the synchronization 
                           between mobile and portable / stationary domains can be identical to that in
                           a federation of cross-nation domains. The services to be synchronized between
                           different technical domains are determined according to a trust relationship
                           and the QoS parameters (e.g. transmission medium, IT security).
                  </p>
                  <p>219. <span class="bold"><strong>Synchronization Data</strong></span></p>
                  <p>220. Generally speaking, the service information of a service used cross-domain
                           which must be synchronized is very extensive. The service information consists
                           of the service description (WSDL file), policies, IT security data (e.g. public
                           key) and the necessary QoS parameters. Overall, it is thought to be too expensive
                           for synchronization in a narrowband network. For synchronizations across narrow 
                           band networks, prepared service forms are on hand and only a small section (e.g.
                           provider name) is transmitted upon synchronization. For this reason, the synchronization
                           data of the service descrip-tion for cross-domain used services must be differently 
                           scalable depending on bandwidth.
                  </p>
                  <p>221. With broadband transmission mediums, more information can be exchanged,
                           up to a complete service description (WSDL File, policies, IT security data
                           and the necessary QoS parameters.
                  </p>
                  <p>222. Conversely, with narrowband transmission mediums, only the characteristics
                           of the service description are transmitted upon synchronization. Based on these 
                           characteristics, the services are registered in the SOA (ESB) infrastructure
                           with the help of a pre-defined template (form) and thus published.
                  </p>
                  <p>223. Due to this, the service descriptions of cross-domain used services are
                           to be categorized in advance via templates and the IT security settings and 
                           QoS parameters correspondingly defined so that only the necessary characteristics
                           are communicated during synchronization. The characteristics, IT security
                           settings, QoS parameters, templates (forms) and the synchronization protocol

                  <p>227. A special method for synchronisation between various domains is the OASIS 
                              WS-Discovery. Service Discovery is the process of finding the services that 
                              are available in the network. When operating in a wireless network environment 
                              where node mobility and shifting network conditions can cause network partitions 
                              and loss of network connections, it is vital to use a service discovery mechanism 
                              that does not rely on the availability of any given node. In other words, a 
                              fully distributed service discovery mechanism is needed. The only standardized 
                              Web service discovery protocol that currently fulfills this requirement by 
                              operating in a distributed mode is WS-Discovery.
                  </p>
                  <p>228. WS-Discovery is designed for use in one of two modes: managed and ad 
                              hoc. In managed mode all nodes communicate through a discovery proxy, an entity 
                              which performs the service discovery function of behalf of all the other nodes, 
                              and which communicates with the other nodes using unicast messages. This mechanism 
                              can be used to achieve interoperability between registry based service discovery 
                              mechanisms and WS-Discovery.
                  </p>
                  <p>229. In ad hoc mode, on the other hand, communication is fully distributed. 
                              Requests for service information are sent using multicast to a known address, 
                              and each node is responsible for answering requests from others about its own 
                              services. The ad hoc mode is intended to be used for local communication only, 
                              and the standard recommends limiting the scope of multicast messages by setting 
                              the time-to-live (TTL) field of the IPv4 header to 1, or by using a link-local 
                              multicast address for IPv6.
                  </p>
                  <p>230. In several experiments the used tactical radio networks consist of a number
                              of ad hoc networks connected to each other using Multi-Topology Routers (MTRs). 
                              The dynamic character of these networks implies that one cannot rely on a 
                              managed mode discovery proxy to remain available, meaning that the distributed 
                              ad hoc mode should be used. However, since this mode is limited to link local 
                              communication it will not provide the multi-network service discovery capability 
                              required in interconnected tactical networks. In order to work around this 
                              issue, it is recommended to allow the multicast discovery messages to travel 
                              across network boundaries by using e.g. a site-local IPv6 address, and increasing 
                              the Hop Limit in the IPv6 header. This solution works within a controlled 
                              network environment, but it is less than ideal for use in larger scale networks.
                              That is because increasing the scope of the multicast messages might cause 
                              the messages to travel further than intended, and thus cause increased network 
                              load in networks where the messages are not needed.
                  </p>
                  <p>231. As it is recommended to allow packets to flow across routers, a request 
                              sent by any one node in the network is received by all other nodes. If the message
                              sent was a probe for available services, then all nodes that did offer a service
                              matching the request would reply with a unicast message to the sender. 
                  </p>
                  <p>232. WS-Discovery can be completely integrated into an ESB, and connected to 
                              the internal service registry. This meant that any announcement made on WS-Discovery
                              would be added to the service registry, which in turn meant that the announced 
                              service could be invoked from any consumer. If WS-Discovery is used as the 
                              only discovery mechanism it is used as a self-contained WS-Discovery application
                              and therefore used for announcing and searching for services. 
                  </p>
                  <p>233. As mentioned above, allowing the multicast packets to traverse routers is 
                              not an ideal solution. An alternative is to combine the managed and ad hoc
                              modes in one deployment. When a WS-Discovery proxy announces its presence, 
                              all other nodes are asked to enter managed mode, relying on the proxy for 
                              service discovery. However, the WS-Discovery specification does not require 
                              the nodes to change to managed mode, and by allowing the majority of nodes 
                              to remain in ad hoc mode and at the same time keep a link local message scope, 
                              one can secure local service discovery without the risk of generating unneeded
                              network traffic in other networks. Combined with discovery proxies that function
                              as relays between the networks, cross-network discovery can be achieved as 
                              well.
                  </p>
                  <p>234. Note that, even though the WS-Discovery specification does allow nodes 
                              to choose not to enter managed mode when receiving a message telling it to 
                              do so, it does not clearly state what the expected behavior of nodes is once 
                              the network consists of nodes in both modes simultaneously. This combination 
                              of modes is desirable when working with multiple interconnected mobile networks, 
                              and therefore a profile of how to use the WS-Discovery standard in this context 
                              should be developed by NATO for interoperability between nations.
                  </p>
                  <p>235. Because of the above mentioned priority of this service, it is recommended
                              to add WS-Discovery to NATO's core services set.

                            (SOAP). SOAP is a standar-dized XML-based, platform-independent communication

                  <p>244. Crucial to the Property Protection of IT Security Architecture is that
                           both provider and consumer conduct a review of the binding (authenticity),
                           integrity and availability of the respective partner. Only through such a 
                           mechanism can the binding (authenticity), integrity and availability of the 
                           respective partner in the mobile ESB field on the side of Property Protection 
                           be guaranteed.
                  </p>
                  <p>245. Each service operation should be autonomous and require no other operation.
                           
                  </p>
                  <p>246. If only a single operation of a service is called up, and all security 
                           requirements met, the individual steps must be processed by the consumer and 
                           provider. However, these security technologies (encryption and signature) 
                           call for additional performance and bandwidth.
                  </p>
                  <p>247. If several service operations are used in succession or it is assured 
                           that the use of a service takes place on a secured basic protection, the IT 
                           security steps for services in the mobile field with a low bandwidth should
                           be optimized so that the complete examination does not have to be carried 
                           out upon every operation, in view of their performance and low bandwidth.
                  </p>
                  <p>248. Such an approach calls for the capability on the part of an ESB (ESB 
                           Stub and SOA (ESB) Infrastruc-ture) to be able to manage and check policy
                           settings, not just globally for one service but for different policies on the
                           operational level of a service. Additionally, the service description (application
                           level) states the requirement that global policies are not only to be developed 
                           for a service but also for every operation.
                  </p>
                  <p>249. The security of information technology is an overarching challenge since
                           every IT system considered individually frequently has its own security concept
                           (and individual implementation) and consequently, its own security domain.
                           An ESB-configuration with Property Protection is no exception.
                  </p>
                  <p>250. A challenge, from the perspective of IT security, is to provide participants
                           with classified data from a different security <a href="#ftn.d0e3080" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="d0e3080">[2]</sup></a> or information 
                           <a href="#ftn.d0e3084" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote" id="d0e3084">[3]</sup></a> 
                           domain to their own (e.g. different authorizations of the users in the domains,
                           different classifications of the domains.) To achieve this, cooperating security 
                           domains are required.
                  </p>
                  <p>251. The binding (authenticity), integrity and availability test by the 
                           consumers and providers is carried out via the ESB Stub and the services of
                           the assigned SOA (ESB) Infrastructure. In order to use the services of other
                           security domains, the relevant security data / information from the respective
                           security domain is required. Consequently, additional specialist services of
                           the SOA (ESB) Infrastructure are necessary in order to, for example, synchronize the relevant security data/information
                     of the co-operating security domains.

                               mechanisms for ap-plications which would like to generate, distribute or
                               receive notifications (one-way notifica-tions). Here the Publish / Subscribe 
                               mechanism is used to which an application registers to receive (subscribe)
                               certain notifications. Applications also provide notifications which should
                               be distributed.

                  <p>253. For different notification patterns, the following concepts are introduced
                             
                  </p>
                  <p>254. <span class="bold"><strong>Publisher:</strong></span> A Publisher sends a notification 
                               to a Broker or to one or more Notification Con-sumers. A Publisher Application 
                               does not necessarily provide an open service endpoint.
                  </p>
                  <p>255. <span class="bold"><strong>Subscriber:</strong></span> A Subscriber conducts a

                               Subscriber can also be the application for a Notification Consumer. A Subscriber 
                               Application provides an open service endpoint.
                  </p>

                               Consumer receives notifications. A &#8216;Push Consumer Application&#8217; provides an

                               Producer can send the notification asynchronously. A &#8216;Pull Consumer Application&#8217; 
                               calls up an operation in the Notification Broker or Notification Producer
                               in order to receive a notification.
                  </p>
                  <p>257. In general, there are many different concepts and implementation possibilities
                               for notification mechanisms. As an example, two different procedures are
                               here presented.

                               subscribes to an application (publisher) which sends the notification and
                               receives a corresponding message (response) which the Notification Consumer
                               receives when the event occurs. When it occurs (3), the Notification Publisher
                               informs the Notification Consumer (4) &#8211; see next figure:

                               on the selected architecture.
                  </p>
                  <p>261. The Notification Pattern however allows both a separate and a combined 
                               implementation.
                  </p>
                  <p>262. In a similar way, the Notification Publisher can also be implemented in 
                               two separate applications. Therefore, the Notification Publisher is divided 
                               into two parts, the Subscriber Manager and the Notification Publisher. The 
                               subscriber manager manages the subscriptions and gives these to the Notification
                               Publisher. The Notification Publisher then distributes the notifications to
                               the Notification Consumers based on the subscriptions.
                  </p>
                  <p>263. Another notification pattern is the:</p>

                               mechanism via Publish / Subscribe takes place:

                               Broker is depicted. In the Notification Pattern via Notification Broker, the
                               notifications which should be distributed are conveyed to the Notification
                               Broker via a Subscriber Manager or are managed respectively (1). Notification
                               Consumers register for the Publish Registration Manager via a Subscriber (2).
                               If an event occurs with a Publisher (3), the Publisher sends the notification
                               to the Notification Broker (4). The Notification Broker sends (6) the notification
                               to the Notification Consumer communicated by the Publish Registration Manager.
