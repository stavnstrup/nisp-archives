                     </div>
                  </div>
               </div>
               <div class="toc">
                  <dl>
                     <dt><span class="sect1"><a href="ch03.html#v1s1-nsd">3.1. NISP Structure Drivers</a></span></dt>

               </div>
               <p>7. The structure of the NISP is determined by several factors:</p>
               <div class="itemizedlist">
                  <ul class="itemizedlist">
                     <li class="listitem">
                        <p>Ease of use for the users of the NISP;</p>
                     </li>
                     <li class="listitem">
                        <p>Implementation strategy of the NNEC vision;</p>
                     </li>
                     <li class="listitem">
                        <p>Nature of standards, profiles and design rules.</p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </div>
               <p>8. Partitioning the NISP into timeframes of near and mid-term was
                      influenced by the NNEC FS, national NEC development and industry
                      best practices. One common thread through all these efforts is the need to
                      partition NATO CIS implementations and transition to NNEC into well
                      defined time periods which are:
               </p>
               <div class="itemizedlist">
                  <ul class="itemizedlist">
                     <li class="listitem">
                        <p>Near-term: 0 to 2 years;</p>
                     </li>
                     <li class="listitem">
                        <p>Mid-term: 2 to 10 years;</p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </div>
               <p>9. The NISP reflects these timeframes in individual volumes. To provide
                      consistency between these volumes and ease of tracking technology trends
                      and influences, each of the volumes has similar structures
                      containing major sections dealing with:
               </p>
               <div class="itemizedlist">
                  <ul class="itemizedlist">
                     <li class="listitem">
                        <p>Technology</p>
                     </li>
                     <li class="listitem">
                        <p>Standards</p>
                     </li>
                     <li class="listitem">
                        <p>Transition</p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </div>
               <p>10. These similar structures enable one to focus in on a stakeholders area of
                      interest and to track this area of interest as it transforms towards the NNEC paradigm.
               </p>
               <p>11. Standards are the focus of volume 2 and 3. The standards referenced in these volumes provide an overview of those standards
                  that must be taken into account when developing profiles and architectures within the applicable period of time.
               </p>
               <p>12. The profiles in volume 4 are based on mission requirements which
                      influence required services and interoperability points.
               </p>
               <p>13. The NISP contains the five following main volumes:</p>
               <p>14. 
                        <span class="bold"><strong>Volume 1 - Overview and Management</strong></span>:
                      This volume provides the management framework for the development and
                      configuration control of the NISP and includes the general management
                      procedures for the application of the NISP in NATO C3 systems development
                      and the process for handling Request for Change Proposals (RFCP).
               </p>
               <p>15. 
                        <span class="bold"><strong>Volume 2 - Near-term</strong></span>: This volume provides the interoperability standards and profiles in the near-term period. This is the short term
                  step describing the state of-the-art of NATO and National systems today and the framework for new systems actually under procurement
                  or specification. For new  systems, it contains near-term standards, profiles, and technologies to support the initial steps
                  towards Networking and Information Infrastructure (NII).
               </p>
               <p>16. 
                        <span class="bold"><strong>Volume 3 - Mid-term</strong></span>: This volume will describe the evolution from platform based legacy systems to the federated Network Enabled Capabilities
                  environment where the functionality is made generally available as &#8220;services on the net&#8221;. Ultimately the goal is that the
                  functionality of the most useful services shall be available to authorized users in each situation. The focus of the volume
                  is on the mid-term perspective having a time frame of 2 to 10 years into the future from the publication of this version of
                  the NISP. This timeframe encompasses the realization of a fully network enabled NATO environment.
               </p>
               <p>17. <span class="bold"><strong>Volume 4 - Profiles</strong></span>: This volume provides Guidance on the development of Interoperability Profiles and references to published profiles. Interoperability
                  Profiles aggregate references to the characteristics of other profiles types to provide a consolidated perspective. Interoperability
                  Profiles identify essential profile elements including Capability Requirements and other NAF architectural views, characteristic
                  protocols, implementation options, technical standards, Service Interoperability Points, and the relationship with other profiles
                  such as the system profile to which an application belongs. Interoperability profiles will be referenced in the NISP for a
                  specified NATO Common Funded System or Capability Package to include descriptions of interfaces to National Systems where
                  appropriate.
                  
               </p>
               <p>18. <span class="bold"><strong>Volume 5 - Design Rules</strong></span>: This volume provides Guidance on the development of Design Rules and references to published design rules.
                  
               </p>
               <p>19. In addition to these five volumes, the NISP includes an Annex volume containing the following appendicies:</p>
               <div class="itemizedlist">
                  <ul class="itemizedlist">
                     <li class="listitem">
                        <p>Services and Interoperability Points in Platform Oriented and SOA Environments;</p>
                     </li>
                     <li class="listitem">
                        <p>NATO, National and Industry NEC Implementation Approaches;</p>
                     </li>
                     <li class="listitem">
                        <p>Reference Models used in volumes 2 through 5 to structure and organise the standards and technologies;</p>
                     </li>
                     <li class="listitem">
                        <p>Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) Profile in the Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) context;</p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
               </div>
               <p>20. Technology standards will transition through a life-cycle. This
                      life-cycle is used to refine the categorisation of standards within volumes 2 and 3 and is also a key to providing guidance
                  on the use of
                      standards in the development and transition of NATO CIS. The NISP has adopted the five categories of in the life-cycle
                  of standards shown below
                      in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html#v1f1-stdscat" title="Figure 3.1. Standards Categories">Figure 3.1</a>.
               </p>
               <div class="figure"><a id="v1f1-stdscat"></a><p></p>
                  <div class="figure-contents">
                     <div class="mediaobject"><img src="../figures/stdscat1.png" alt="Standards Categories" /></div>
                  </div>
                  <p class="title"><strong>Figure 3.1. Standards Categories</strong></p>
               </div><br class="figure-break" /><p>21. Proposed standards can be accepted as emerging standards in order to
                      follow their developments and decide if they can be promoted to mandatory
                      standards. In some cases proposed standards can be readily accepted as
                      mandatory standards. Emerging standards have been partitioned into
                      specific categories of emerging near-term, and emerging
                      mid-term to better support the transition to NNEC. Similarly, containment
                      standards have been classified as either fading or retired.
               </p>
               <p>22. A short description of each category is described below:</p>
               <div class="itemizedlist">
                  <ul class="itemizedlist">

                                   considered <span class="bold"><strong>mandatory</strong></span> if it is mature

                                   within existing systems and in within mid-term future planned
                                   systems.
                        </p>

                                   there is insufficient support from commercial
                                   companies or because the underlying technology is considered not
                                   mature enough.  In these latter cases they could be categorized as <span class="bold"><strong>Emerging far-term</strong></span>.

                  <p>24. In general, systems development approaches suggest a clean line of
                           reasoning from requirements capturing to architecture, to design and
                           build via testing to implementation and utilisation and finally to
                           retirement. In practice there is not always an opportunity (time or
                           money) for such a "clean" approach and compromises must be made: from
                           requirements immediately to build and implementation. In recognition of
                           this fact NATO has developed a parallel track approach, which allows some
                           degree of freedom in the systems development approach. Although
                           variations in sequence and speed of the different steps in the approach
                           are possible, some elements need to be present in one form or another.
                           Architecture, including the selection of appropriate standards and
                           technologies, is such a mandatory step.
                  </p>
                  <p>25. In a top-down execution of the systems development approach,
                           architecture will provide guidance and overview to the required
                           functionality and the solution patterns, based on long-standing and
                           visionary operational requirements. In a bottom-up execution of the
                           approach, usually responding to urgent requirements and operational
                           imperatives, architecture will be used to assess and validate chosen
                           solution in order to align with the longer term vision.
                  </p>
                  <p>26. The NISP is a major tool for the architecture work and must be
                           suitable for use in the different variations of the systems development
                           approach.
                  </p>
                  <p>27. SOA, NNEC Roadmap milestones, and the agreed Overarching Architecture also influence the structure of the NISP.</p>

                              architectures are to be developed within NATO: namely Baseline
                              Architectecture (BA), Target Architecture (TA), Reference Architecture
                              (RA), and Overarching Architecture (OA). These architecture types can be
                              related to the NISP Volumes 2 and 3 as follows:

                              is of a reciprocal nature. The OA also provides inputs to the NISP by
                              identifying the technology areas that in the future will require
                              standards. The OA also provides guidance on the coherence of standards
                              by indicating in which timeframe certain standards and profiles are
                              required.
                     </p>
                     <p>30. The work on RA's and TA's will benefit from the NISP by selecting
                              coherent sets of standards for profiles and design rules.
