                  <p>281. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international consortium aiming
                           to enable the full scope of possibilities for and to ensure continuous growth
                           of the World Wide Web by standardization (protocols and guidelines).
                  </p>
                  <p>282. The challenge when creating open, standardized service endpoints and a
                           standardized SOA-(ESB-) infrastructure is the development of lists of standards
                           that a SOA-environment must support. This list of standards should form a kind
                           a profile in order to create a uniform access to the service-endpoints.
                  </p>
                  <p>283. There are efforts by the W3C, to define a profile &#8211; the WS-I Basic Profile
                           &#8211; that could be used as basis for a service-endpoint.
                  </p>
                  <p>284. However, not all capabilities/requirements related to overarching and
                           shared services of a SOA-(ESB-) infrastructure, e. g. related to registry, 
                           repository or policies are included in the standards.
                  </p>
                  <p>285. Generally a SOA (ESB) must not support all standards. But the more a SOA
                           (ESB) is employed overarchingly in heterogeneous IT-sceneries, the more the
                           extended WS* - Specifications gain importance.
                  </p>
                  <p>286. The following table summarizes the capabilities, the existing technologies 
                           and the associated related WS* -Specifications in an overview.

                           services (SRE):

                  <p>291. Besides the standardized service-interfaces (open service-endpoints), 
                           the service layer of the SOA-model encompasses the mechanisms for service 
                           administration as well as specialized services. In the broader sense the specialized 
                           services are cross-functions for an ESB.
                  </p>
                  <p>292. To make services work it takes more than SOAP, WSDL and UDDI. Services
                           must work with different security-levels. Complex processes between several 
                           services must be able to execute related roll-back-mechanisms as transactions.
                           Also routing and general Quality-of-Service rules are of importance in a global
                           infrastructure
                  </p>
                  <p>293. Further on services must be labeled with defined Service Level Agreements 
                           in order to sufficiently define their quality features.
                  </p>
                  <p>294. A global service-architecture, that provides a SOA-(ESB-) infrastructure
                           for services, can be illustrated as a layer-model composed of a Core Layer and
                           a Higher Layer.

                                             of the architecture comprises XML and SOAP. XML is the basis of all formats
                                             and protocols. As a default SOAP can be transferred via TCP / IP and HTTP.
                                             The flexibility of SOAP also allows other transfer protocols.

                  <p>295. Now we look at services that are necessary for the provision of a service 
                           (service infrastructure). They are the SOA-(ESB-) infrastructure.
                  </p>
                  <p>296. From the SOA-perspective the specialized services, that form the SOA-(ESB-) 
                           infrastructure, are also &#8222;just services&#8220;, which in turn are based on SOA-mechanisms.
                           
                  </p>
                  <p>297. Under consideration of the SRE capability 3 (The reference environment
                           for services (SRE) is based on different classifications of the providers 
                           (service classes)) the specialized services of the SOA-(ESB) infrastructure
                           form a superior, self-sufficient service-class on the ESB. A service of the
                           specialized services of the SOA-(ESB-) infrastructure is either self-sufficient
                           (does not use further services), or uses only services of self-sufficient service
                           sub-classes of the SOA-(ESB-) infrastructure.
                  </p>
                  <p>298. The necessary SOA-(ESB-) infrastructure (specialized services) resulting 
                           from the use of services leads to the following capabilities/requirements for
                           the ESB:

                           service (Registry and Repository) and the services and the procedure for the
                           area of security. A SOA-(ESB-) infrastructure comprises much more specialized
                           services that are being used by consumers and providers and further specialized 
                           services that are necessary to ensure operations of an ESB-configuration.

                                of all service information. A Registry and Repository System regulates first
                                and foremost the collaboration of management and monitoring tools which in
                                turn enable run-time policies or Service Level Agreements (SLAs) to be monitored.
                                To this end, the Registry and Repository System automatically analyses run-time 
                                data. The registry must be closely interlocked with the ESB, as well as with 
                                the management and monitoring tools.

                                in the application, SRE prefers the inclusion of separate Registry and
