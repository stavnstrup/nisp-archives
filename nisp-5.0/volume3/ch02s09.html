                  <p>185. Situation-dependent information extraction uses advanced
                     algorithms to support situation associative processing and improve
                     human systems collaboration. Tools are needed to go beyond static data
                     filtering and template matching. Early work has shown that Bayesian
                             networks, statistical analysis, and hidden Markov models can be used
                             to extract meaning and context from complex and cluttered data
                             streams. Application of the se techniques for disparate sensors that
                             are not temporally or specially matched would enable NATO to detect,
                             discern, analyze, and understand the actions of stealthy adversaries
                             embedded in complex domains.

                             exploitation capability to handle exabytes of data at transfer rates
                             of terabytes per second, coupled to decision timelines in seconds to
                             minutes. As the threat base evolves, there will be a greater
                             dependence on integrated, multiple-domain sensors with much greater
                             dynamic range, spatial reach, sample rate, and temporal history.
                             Mega-scale data management will apply an integrated, federated, and

                             increase the war fighter&#8217;s ability to make timely decisions with an
                             explicit evidential basis and reduced the level of information
                             overload often experienced in answering prioritized information
                             requests. User-defined knowledge sharing will minimize catastrophic

                  <p>189. Application Vulnerability Description Language (AVDL) is a
                             security interoperability standard for creating a uniform method of
                             describing application security vulnerabilities using XML. With the
                             growing adoption of web-based technologies, applications have become
                             far more dynamic, with changes taking place daily or even hourly.
                             Consequently, enterprises must deal with a constant flood of new
                             security patches from their application and infrastructure
                             vendors.
                  </p>
                  <p>190. To make matters worse, network-level security products do little
                             to protect against vulnerabilities at the application level. To
                             address this problem, enterprises today have deployed a host of
                             best-of-breed security products to discover application
                             vulnerabilities, block application-layer attacks, repair vulnerable
                             web sites, distribute patches, and manage security events. Enterprises
                             have come to view application security as a continuous life-cycle.
                             Unfortunately, there is currently no standard way for the products
                             these enterprises have implemented to communicate with each other,
                             making the overall security management process far too manual,
                             time-consuming, and error prone.

                  <p>193. The Common Alerting Protocol is a simple but general format for
                             exchanging all-hazard emergency alerts and public warnings over all
                             kinds of networks. CAP is a XML-based data format for exchanging
                             public warnings and emergencies between alerting technologies. CAP
                             allows a warning message to be consistently disseminated
                             simultaneously over many warning systems to many applications. CAP
                             increases warning effectiveness and simplifies the task of activating
                             a warning for responsible officials. Individuals can receive
                             standardized alerts from many sources and configure their applications
                             to process and respond to the alerts as desired.
