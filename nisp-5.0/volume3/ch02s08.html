                             maintain communications while on the move. Wireless sensor networks,
                             on the other hand, are stationary. They are often deployed in areas
                             hostile to humans and relay on a variety of observational data that
                             are passed onto military personnel stationed at safer vantage
                             points.

                                  intended for use by mobile nodes in an ad hoc network. It offers
                                  quick adaptation to dynamic link conditions, low processing and
                                  memory overhead, low network utilization, and establishment of both
                                  unicast and multicast routes between sources and destinations. It
                                  uses destination sequence numbers to ensure loop freedom at all
                                  times (even in the face of anomalous delivery of routing control
                                  messages), solving problems (such as ``counting to infinity'')

                     </div>
                     <p>176. The Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) is a routing protocol for
                                  wireless mesh networks. It is similar to AODV in that it forms a
                                  route on-demand when a transmitting computer requests one. However,
                                  it uses source routing instead of relying on the routing table at
                                  each intermediate device.
                     </p>
                     <p>177. Determining source routes requires accumulating the address of
                                  each device between the source and destination during route
                                  discovery. The accumulated path information is cached by nodes
                                  processing the route discovery packets. The learned paths are used
                                  to route packets. To accomplish source routing, the routed packets
                                  contain the address of each device the packet will traverse. This
                                  may result in high overhead for long paths or large addresses, like
                                  IPv6. To avoid using source routing, DSR optionally defines a flow
                                  id option that allows packets to be forwarded on a hop-by-hop
                                  basis.
                     </p>
                     <p>178. This protocol is truly based on source routing whereby all the
                                  routing information is maintained (continually updated) at mobile
                                  nodes. It has only 2 major phases which are Route Discovery and
                                  Route Maintenance. Route Reply would only be generated if the
                                  message has reached the intended destination node (route record
                                  which is initially contained in Route Request would be inserted into
                                  the Route Reply).
                     </p>
                     <p>179. To return the Route Reply, the destination node must have a
                                  route to the source node. If the route is in the Destination Node's
                                  route cache, the route would be used. Otherwise, the node will
                                  reverse the route based on the route record in the Route Reply
                                  message header (symmetric links). In the event of fatal
                                  transmission, the Route Maintenance Phase is initiated whereby the
                                  Route Error packets are generated at a node. The erroneous hop will
                                  be removed from the node's route cache; all routes containing the
                                  hop are truncated at that point. Again, the Route Discovery Phase is
                                  initiated to determine the most viable route.

                                  allows for a very rapid recovery when routes in the network

                             wireless spectrum and have intelligent nodes that could automatically
                             optimize the network. If a connection spans reliable and unreliable
                             parts of a network, there could be performance issues: if a packet
                             makes it through the reliable region but is dropped in the unreliable
                             part, it would have to be resent through the entire connection. A
                             Knowledge Based Network would automatically break this connection into
                             two smaller connections, one across the reliable region and one across
                             the unreliable region. Then, if data is lost across the unreliable
                             part, it would only need to be re-sent along that region of the
                             network. This technique could increase bandwidth tenfold.

                  <p>183. Also, in a knowledge based network it would take note of
                             frequently accessed data and save copies on the edge of the network
                             for quick access: the idea is If one soldier needs a piece of map
                             data, then the guys around him will need it too. Artificial
                             intelligence could even decide which protocols to use.
                  </p>
                  <p>184. Such an intelligent network would not only understand how to
                             move data; it would also be able to understand what the data meant to
                             users. This idea is based on this concept of the Semantic Web, which
                             called for Web pages to include machine-readable data in addition to
                             content intended to be read by people. Software agents would use this
                             data to understand the meaning of documents instead of simply
                             searching for keywords.
