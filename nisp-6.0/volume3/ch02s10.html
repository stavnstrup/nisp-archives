                  <p>198. For decades, the size of silicon-based transistors has decreased
                     steadily while their performance has improved. As the devices approach
                     their physical limits, though, researchers have started looking to
                     less conventional structures and materials. Single-walled carbon
                             nanotubes are one prominent candidate -- already researchers have
                             built carbon nanotube transistors that show promising performance.
                             According to estimates, carbon nanotubes have the potential to produce
                             transistors that run 10 times faster than even anticipated future
                             generations of silicon-based devices, while at the same time using
                             less power.

                  <p>201. Most flexible electronics, such as those used in e-paper and
                             roll-up displays for mobile devices, rely on transistors made of
                             either organic polymers, printed directly on a plastic substrate, or
                             amorphous, or noncrystalline, silicon. However, transistors made of
                             these materials can't perform at the gigahertz speeds needed for
                             complex circuitry or antennas.
                  </p>
                  <p>202. People have for some time been able to make slow flexible
                             electronics, but the speed of the transistors has been limited. The
                             next step has been to make the transistors out of high-quality,
                             single-crystal silicon instead of organic polymers and amorphous
                             silicon because electrons simply move faster in single-crystal
                             silicon.

                  <p>205. Optical fibers can quickly transmit huge amounts of data. But
                             the technology for sorting and sending photons lags far behind the
                             microelectronics that generates and process the data, putting a crimp
                             on bandwidths. In the past few years, scientists and engineers have
                             made great strides in miniaturizing photonic devices and integrating
                             them onto a single chip. Such advances allow for cheaper
                             manufacturing, smaller sizes, and higher performance. Along the way
                             they've developed techniques for working with materials common to the
                             semiconductor industry, which is a step toward integrating photonics
                             and electronics on the same chip. And these researchers have made
                             structures with phenomenal precision, in some cases down to distances
                             smaller than those that separate atoms.
                  </p>
                  <p>206. Even with these successes, however, a major obstacle remained.
                             Light delivered via cylindrical fiber optics breaks into different
                             polarizations, or orientations of light waves. In devices at the
                             microscale, the outputs change depending on if the waves are oriented
                             vertically or horizontally so they're suited to processing only
                             certain polarizations, which can lead to weakened signals. If
                             researchers are limited to using horizontally polarized light, for
                             example, they end up throwing away vertically polarized light and lose
                             half the signal strength. That's a problem particularly when sending
                             signals over long distances, such as between continents.
                  </p>
                  <p>207. One approach to this problem is to run light through more than
                             one device, each specifically designed to process one polarization.
                             Researchers at MIT's Research Laboratory of Electronics took a
                             different approach. Rather than building separate devices for
                             different light polarizations, they invented a device for converting
                             vertically polarized light into horizontally polarized light. First,
                             the device splits light into its horizontally and vertically polarized
                             components, directing these into separate channels. Then it gradually
                             rotates the vertically polarized light to make it horizontal. At this
                             point, the light in both channels has the same polarization. This
                             makes it possible to use identical devices to process that light. As a
                             result, all of the light is processed in the same way, allowing clear,
                             strong signals.
                  </p>
                  <p>208. The current advance pertains only to those photonic applications
                             that involve light with multiple polarizations and those
                             communications applications that involve fiber optics. There hasn't
                             been much economic pressure in the past couple of years to develop
                             technology for these applications because of a glut in bandwidth, but
                             now communications demands are increasing again.

                  <p>211. Researchers have fabricated high performance, transparent
                             thin-film transistors (TFTs) using a low-cost, low-temperature method.
                             They use indium oxide as both a semiconductor and a conductor,
                             combining the inorganic material with organic insulators on top of a
                             transparent substrate. The resulting transistors perform nearly as
                             well as the much more expensive polysilicon transistors used to
                             control pixels in high-end TVs and computer monitors.
                  </p>
                  <p>212. On glass that's been coated with a transparent electrode, the
                             researchers deposit the organic insulating materials, which form a
                             multilayered lattice. To deposit the indium oxide, the researchers use
                             a standard technique called ion-assisted deposition, in which an ion
                             beam controls the crystallization and adhesion of the oxide. Changing
                             the oxygen pressure during the process varies the conductivity of the
                             indium oxide, which can thus be used as a semiconductor in one part of
                             the device and as a conductor in other parts.

                               <span class="bold"><strong>Importance:</strong></span> The new TFTs could
                             replace the opaque transistors used to control pixels in digital
                             displays. Because the low-temperature method can deposit transistors
                             on flexible plastics, it could lead to see-through displays affixed to
                             curved surfaces such as windshields and helmet visors. The method is
                             also cheap enough, and easy enough to adapt for large-scale
                             manufacturing, that it could make such displays affordable. Imagine a
                             vehicle windshield that displays a map to your destination, military
                             goggles with targets and instructions displayed right before a
                             soldier's eyes.

                             licensing the technology have begun. Prototype displays could be ready
                             within 18 months. The researchers hope to improve the performance of
                             the transistors so that they could serve as processors or memory
                             cells.
