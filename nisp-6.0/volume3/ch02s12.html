               <p>251. It seems that no matter how advanced notebook computers get, their
                        battery life remains at a standstill: 2-3 hours from most models,
                        regardless of price. From electric vehicles to portable electronics,
                        today's battery capacity lags far behind the steady improvements in
                        other areas of technology. Despite the hype and advertising from battery
                        manufacturers, today's chemical batteries are virtually identical to
                        ones sold three decades ago.
               </p>
               <p>252. It's not that battery manufacturers aren't trying to develop
                        something better: efforts to improve battery capacity and power density
                        have been underway for years. Despite the research, arguably the best
                        technology they have produced yet is the ingenious battery testing strip
                        that you can use to check how quickly your batteries have gone
                        dead.
               </p>
               <p>253. Today's battery technology is simply outdated. The chemicals are
                        extremely hazardous to the environment (Nickel-Cadmium, for example, is
                        made from two heavy metals that are toxic to practically all forms of
                        life on the planet), dangerous to nearby users (risk of explosions),
                        heavy (standard car batteries can weigh 70+ pounds) and unreliable. They
                        charge slowly, their output voltage wavers, and their size becomes a
                        major limiting factor when designing portable electronics like digital
                        cameras.
               </p>
               <p>254. Portable power is a crucial enabling technology for a vast array
                        of applications. Some of these applications include:

                                     don't deliver the horsepower. AIBO, Sony's robotic pet, only barks
                                     for 2-3 hours on a typical charge, and the working prototypes of

                                     fault of the battery technology: it requires a thousand pounds of

                                     power is clean, renewable, safe, reliable and environmentally
                                     friendly. Unfortunately, it's expensive to install, and the single
                                     greatest cost often comes from the batteries, not the solar panels.
                                     Batteries for solar systems are typically large, heavy, dangerous
                                     (risk of explosions), expensive and short-lived (many need replacing
                                     in a mere five years). A breakthrough in power density and storage
                                     costs could revolutionize the solar industry, making residential and
                                     commercial solar systems far more affordable. If battery costs could
                                     be halved, it would subtract five years from the average twenty-year

                        matters: it's the cost as well. To herald a genuine breakthrough, the
                        next wave of technology needs to be better on all counts: size, weight
                        and cost.

                  <p>256. The most promising candidate technology that meets this
                             requirement is fuel cell technology. Fuel cells are clean, small and
                             lightweight, and will eventually be cheap to produce. The choice of
                             fuels for those fuel cells, however, remains undecided.
                  </p>
                  <p>257. One of the promising contenders is zinc -- one of the most
                             abundant minerals in the planet. With the help of fuel cell membranes,
                             zinc particles release electricity when oxidized by exposing them to
                             air. Once all the zinc is oxidized, the zinc particles can be quickly
                             "recharged" (reversing the oxidation process with the help of
                             electricity) and used again. This process can be endlessly repeated,
                             since the zinc never wears out.
                  </p>
                  <p>258. Zinc is promising because it offers high density portable power
                             (far greater power density than chemical batteries), a
                             widely-available element, and outstanding safety (zinc won't explode
                             if exposed to flames or high temperatures). The industry leader in
                             portable zinc power is Metallic Power

                  <p>259. Zinc power isn't seeing many headlines these days. Much of the
                             news about portable fuel cells seems focused on methanol. These
                             so-called Direct Methanol Fuel Cells (DMFCs) convert methanol (a
                             common alcohol that can be derived from corn, among other renewable
                             sources) into electricity. NEC, Samsung, and already have working
                             prototypes of DMFCs for notebook computers or portable
                             electronics.
                  </p>
                  <p>260. The problem with methanol is its combustibility: methanol
                             ignites easily and has a flash point ranging from room temperature to
                             130 degrees (F), depending on the concentration of water in the
                             mixture. That makes it an illegal explosive according to the laws of
                             many countries, meaning that DMFCs would not be allowed on airplanes
                             unless existing regulations are changed.
                  </p>
                  <p>261. Methanol also has the drawback of not being easily renewed by
                             consumers. Few people have the know-how to distill methanol in their
                             own garage, meaning that consumers would be dependent on DMFC
                             manufacturers for methanol recharge kits. Like ink jet printer refill
                             kits, this is where DMFC manufacturers will probably make the bulk of
                             their profits.

                             the widespread adoption of a fuel cell battery standard. Today's
                             chemical batteries are holding back promising applications for
                             emerging technologies, and only a breakthrough in portable power can
                             overcome those limitations. Fuel cells can make the leap, and their
                             adoption by consumers and manufacturers alike is all but
                             assured.

                               <span class="bold"><strong>Importance:</strong></span> Fuel cells are very
                             useful as power sources and offer significant savings of loads, in
                             weight and volume, compared to conventional power sources. Because
                             fuel cells have no moving parts and do not involve combustion, in
                             ideal conditions they can achieve up to 99.9999% reliability. This
                             equates to less than one minute of down time in a six year
                             period.
