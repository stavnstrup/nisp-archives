               <p>88. The "Cloud" in Cloud computing describes a combination of
                  inter-connected networks. This technology area focuses on breaking up a
                  task into sub-tasks. The sub-tasks are then executed simultaneously on
                  two or more computers that are communicating with each other over the
                        &#8220;Cloud&#8221;. Later, the completed sub-tasks are reassembled to form the
                        completed original main task. There are many different types of
                        distributed computing systems and many issues to overcome in
                        successfully designing one. Many of these issues deal with accommodating
                        a wide-ranging mix of computer platforms with assorted capabilities that
                        could potentially be networked together

                          <span class="bold"><strong>Implications</strong></span>: The main goal of a
                        cloud computing system is to connect users and resources in a
                        transparent, open, and scalable way. Ideally this arrangement is
                        drastically more fault tolerant and more powerful than many combinations
                        of stand-alone computer systems. If practiced in a NATO environment,
                        member nations would consume their IT services in the most
                        cost-effective way, over a broad range of services (for example,
                        computational power, storage and business applications) from the
                        "cloud", rather than from on-premises equipment.

                  <p>90. Cloud-computing platforms have given many businesses flexible
                             access to computing resources, ushering in an era in which, among
                             other things, startups can operate with much lower infrastructure
                             costs. Instead of having to buy or rent hardware, users can pay for
                             only the processing power that they actually use and are free to use
                             more or less as their needs change. However, relying on cloud
                             computing comes with drawbacks, including privacy, security, and
                             reliability concerns.

                                  your demand. Conversely, if your application is idle then you scale
                                  down then amount of computing resources that you allocate.

                  <p>97. Grid computing is the collective name of technologies that
                             attempt to combine a set of distributed nodes into a common resource
                             pool. The term grid computing stems from an analogy with electric
                             power grids that combine a large set of resources (power plants,
                             transformers, power lines) into simple well defined product (the power
                             outlet) that the user can use without having to know the details of
                             the infrastructure behind it.
                  </p>
                  <p>98. Typical for grid computing is also that it offers a framework
                             for management of node memberships, access control, and life cycle
                             management. Common applications of grid computing allow well defined
                             organisations to share computational resources or storage resources so
                             that resources may be used efficiently and resource demanding tasks
                             can be performed that would otherwise have required large specialised
                             and/or local investments.

                             have also evolved that make the task of setting up a Grid
                             easier and provide a common interface to application
                             developers. Such standardisation efforts have resulted in

                     <p>103. OSGi is a standard for a framework for remotely manageable
                                  networked devices <a class="xref" href="bi01.html#r30" title="The OSGi Standard Forum">[5]</a>. Applications can be securely provisioned to
                                  a network node running an OSGi framework during runtime and thus
                                  provides the possibility to dynamically manage the services and
                                  functionality of the network node. The OSGi model is based upon a
                                  service component architecture, where all functionality in the node
                                  is provided as "small" service components (called bundles). All
                                  services are context aware of each other and heavily adapt their
                                  functionality depending on what other services are available.
                                  Services must degrade gracefully when the services they depend upon
                                  are not available in the framework. These network nodes are designed
                                  to reliably provide their services 24/7/365. Adding an OSGi Service
                                  Platform to a networked node/device adds the capability to manage
                                  the life cycle of the software components in the device. Adding new
                                  services thus makes it more future proof and gives the node
                                  flexibility.
                     </p>
                     <p>104. OSGi adopts a SOA based approach where all bundles deployed
                                  into an OSGi framework are described using well defined service
                                  interfaces. The bundle uses the framework's name service for
                                  publishing offered services and to retrieve services needed by the
                                  bundle itself. OSGi works well together with other standards and
                                  initiatives for example Jini or Web Services. OSGi is also an
                                  example of a technology where integration is carried out in the Java
                                  environment but the actual implementation of the services can be
                                  written in other languages, such as C.

                  <p>105. Another trend in distributed system is to decrease the
                             dependence on centralised resources. A centralised resource is
                             typically some service of function implemented by dedicated nodes in
                             the distributed system that many of or all other nodes depend on to
                             perform their own services or functions. Examples of such services are
                             shared databases, network routing and configuration functions, and
                             name or catalogue services. Obviously, this may cause dependability
                             problems as the centralised server becomes a potential single point of
                             failure (). From some points of view, decentralisation (i.e To
                             decrease the dependence single nodes), is therefore a property to
                             strive for. However, decentralisation may also result in a (sometimes
                             perceived) loss of control that fits poorly with traditional ways of
                             thinking of, for example, security. Decentralisation can thus have a
                             rather long-reaching impact on the way distributed systems are
                             designed.
                  </p>
                  <p>106. Taken to its extreme, decentralisation strives for distributed
                             systems where all nodes are considered equal in all respects (except
                             of course their performance and capacity), i.e., all nodes are
                             considered to peers. This is the foundation to peer-to-peer (P2P)
                             systems, which will be discussed later. In such systems,
                             decentralisation is realised by offering mechanisms to maintain a
                             global shared state that is not stored by any single node.

                     <p>107. Peer-to-peer, or P2P for short, is a technology trend that has
                                  received much attention in recent years. Unfortunately, much of this
                                  attention has been oriented towards questionable applications of
                                  P2P, such as illegal file sharing, rather than towards its merits as
                                  a technology that addresses important problems with traditional
                                  distributed systems.
                     </p>
                     <p>108. The fundamental idea behind P2P is, as is implied by its name,
                                  that all participating nodes in a distributed system shall be
                                  treated as peers, or equals. This is a clear deviation from the
                                  client/server concept, where some nodes play a central role as
                                  servers and other nodes play a role as clients. In those systems,
                                  the server nodes become critical for the system function, and thus
                                  need to be dependable, highly accessible, and dimensioned to handle
                                  a sometimes unpredictable workload. Obviously this may make a server
                                  node both a performance bottleneck and a dependability risk. P2P
                                  addresses such problems.

                     </div><br class="figure-break" /><p>109. The fundamental important property of many P2P applications is
                                  that they allow storage of named objects, such as files, services,
                                  or database entries, to be spread over all nodes in a system instead
                                  of having to store and access them on centralised server nodes.
                                  Object names can be numbers or character strings; whichever is
                                  appropriate for the applications. Once stored in the system, any
                                  node can access a named object just by knowing its name. This means
                                  that a P2P system can have a global shared state that does not
                                  depend on any centralised node.
                     </p>
                     <p>110. While in principle avoiding a centralised solution, many early
                                  P2P systems, such as the Napster file sharing system actually relied
                                  on some central functions in order to implement the mapping from
                                  object names to object locations. However, in later generations of
                                  P2P decentralisation has been taken another step further, by the
                                  introduction of overlay networks, earlier in this report mentioned
                                  as a form of virtual networks.
                     </p>
                     <p>111. With an overlay network, a distributed means of finding the
                                  node that is responsible for storing an object with a given name is
                                  provided. Typically the set of all possible object names, called the
                                  name space, is divided into subsets such that each node becomes
                                  responsible for one subset of the name space. This means that the
                                  need for centralised resources is completely avoided. For a node to
                                  become part of a P2P system, i.e. To join the overlay network, all
                                  that is needed is knowledge of any other node already part of the
                                  system. As nodes join and leave the system, the responsibility for
                                  name space subsets is automatically redistributed.
                     </p>
                     <p>112. The development of overlay network based P2P systems has been
                                  driven by a striving to improve scalability, guarantees, and
                                  robustness. Today, a logarithmic logical scalability can be
                                  achieved, which means that to find a given node from any other node
                                  in the system requires at most logk(N) node-to-node messages to be
                                  sent, where k is some constant and N is the maximum number of nodes
                                  in the system. Note, however, that this scalability measure does not
                                  automatically translate into an exact measure of the actual time it
                                  takes to send a message between two nodes as this time will depend
                                  also on the distribution of nodes on the underlying physical
                                  network.
                     </p>
                     <p>113. The scalability issue has been addressed by a number
                                  of proposed P2P implementation techniques developed within
                                  academic research projects such as Chord
                                  <a class="xref" href="bi01.html#r45" title="Chord">[13]</a>, Pastry <a class="xref" href="bi01.html#r46" title="Pastry">[14]</a>, and
                                  Tapestry <a class="xref" href="bi01.html#r47" title="Tapestry">[15]</a>. However, scalability has
                                  been taken yet another step further by the DKS system
                                  developed at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science
                                  (SICS. In DKS, the amount of administrative traffic required
                                  to keep track of nodes in the overlay network is
                                  significantly reduced, and dimensioning parameters of the
                                  system can be fine-tuned in a very general framework (that
                                  actually treats the other mentioned techniques as special
                                  cases) so as to improve the practical scalability.
                     </p>
                     <p>114. Another important aspect of P2P systems is also the guarantees
                                  that can be given that any named object stored in the systems also
                                  can found. Such guarantees have improved over the P2P technology
                                  generations, and 100% guarantees can now be given by the DKS system
                                  assuming that there are no errors such as physical communication
                                  failures that make nodes unreachable. As intermittent or lasting
                                  communication failures must be expected in any practical system,
                                  techniques for improving the fault tolerance by means of replication
                                  of data have been investigated and are now being included into the
                                  general frameworks of P2P technologies.

                                  DKS in distributed systems need to be investigated in order to
                                  determine how well scalability and robustness functions in practise
                                  given the impact of underlying infrastructure and application
                                  properties. An example of an ongoing such project investigates the
                                  properties of a DKS based implementation of central service in the
                                  OpenSIS standard <a class="xref" href="bi01.html#r48" title="DKS">[16]</a>.

                     <p>116. To summarise, P2P technologies have matured into a practical
                                  way of organising distributed systems in a decentralised way that is
                                  both highly scalable and reliable. Excellent reviews and
                                  descriptions of P2P technologies can be found in <a class="xref" href="bi01.html#r21" title="Toward Internet distributed computing, web services, peer-to-peer, grid computing, ad hoc networks">[1]</a>, <a class="xref" href="bi01.html#r24" title="Theme Issue On Peer-to-Peer Computing">[2]</a>, and
