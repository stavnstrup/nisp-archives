               <p>122. Networked computing is a set of technologies that treats the
                          network as a computing platform, enables machine to machine
                          communication, and offer efficient new ways to help networked
                          computers organise and draw conclusions from online data.

                  <p>124. Web Services are software systems that enable machine to
                               machine interaction over a network. The Web Services present
                               themselves as web based Application Programming Interfaces (API)
                               that use XML messages to communicate. The core standards are covered in
                               Volume 2 and this section covers emerging extentions.

                                         proposed by Microsoft, and Siebel Systems. It is XML-based and
                                         is designed as a layer on top of WSDL that allows a standardised
                                         way of describing business process flows in terms of web
                                         services. A BPEL process can be used either to describe an
                                         executable work flow in a node (orchestration), or to describe
                                         the protocol for interaction between participants in a business
                                         process (choreography). <span class="bold"><strong>Status</strong></span>:

                                         change. An architecture based on the idea of a

                                         can be used to build adaptive networks that are

                                         services in a network and for creating spontaneous

                                         accomplished. Service providers supply clients with
                                         portable Java technology based objects that implements
                                         the service and gives the client access to the

                                         Compute resources have assets diminished or fail and new ones
                                         are introduced into the network. Applications executing on

                                         Platform, Enterprise Edition or J2EE up to version 1.4) <a class="xref" href="bi01.html#r40" title="Java EE">[9]</a> is
                                         a specification of a platform and a code library that is part of
                                         the Java Platform. It is used mainly for developing and running
                                         distributed multi-tier Java applications, based largely on
                                         modular software components running on a platform (application
                                         server). The platform provides the application with support for
                                         handling of transactions, security, scalability, concurrency and
                                         management of deployed applications. Applications are easily
                                         ported between different Java EE application servers.
                                         Applications developed for the Java EE can easily support Web
                                         Services. Java EE is often compared to Microsoft .Net <a class="xref" href="bi01.html#r41" title="Microsoft .NET Developer Homepage">[10]</a>, a
                                         comparison that is beyond the scope of this document. But it
                                         shall be noted that .Net is a product and framework closely
                                         related to development for the Windows operating system whereas
                                         Java EE is a specification that is followed by many product
                                         vendors.

                                         the program. The framework also includes libraries for
                                         development of web service applications.

                  <p>140. The Semantic Web initiative will make searches more accurate
                               and enable increasingly sophisticated information services like
                               intelligent agents that can find products and services, schedule
                               appointments and make purchases. The initiative includes a sort of
                               grammar and vocabulary that provide information about a document's
                               components; this information will enable Web software to act on the
                               meaning of Web content. Semantic Web software and Web services
                               promise to shift the nature of the Web from a publishing and
                               communications medium to an information management
                               environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>141. Semantic Web software includes a special set of Extensible
                               Mark-up Language (XML) tags that includes Uniform Resource
                               Identifiers (URL), a Resource Description Framework (RDF), and a Web
                               Ontology Language (OWL).
                  </p>
                  <p>142. Semantic Web software makes it possible for an intelligent
                               agent to carry out the request "show me the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
                               (UAV) operating in the current area of responsibility" even if there
                               is no explicit list, because it knows that "area of responsibility"
                               has the property "location" with the value "Kandahar", and in
                               searching a directory of UAVs it knows to skip UAVs belonging to the
                               United States, whose location value is "Kabul", but include German
                               UAVs, whose location value is "Kandahar".
                  </p>
                  <p>143. Semantic Web software organises Web information so that search
                               engines and intelligent agents can understand properties and
                               relationships. A university, for example, could be defined as an
                               institution of higher education, which is a class of objects that
                               has a set of properties like a population of students.
                  </p>
                  <p>144. The World Wide Web Consortium released standards in February
                               2004 that define the two foundation elements of the Semantic Web
                               initiative: the Resource Description Framework (RDF), which provides
                               a structure for interpreting information, and the Web Ontology
                               Language (OWL), which provides a means for defining the properties
                               and relationships of objects in Web information.
                  </p>
                  <p>145. Web services provide a way for software to communicate with
                               each other over the Web, enabling a form of distributed computing in
                               which simple services can be combined to carry out complicated tasks
                               like financial transactions.

                  <p>146. Our most fundamental sensors are our senses themselves. They
                               are quite sophisticated, the product of a complex evolutionary
                               design. And yet we've improved on them as time has passed:
                               telescopes and microscopes extend our eyes, thermometers extend our
                               touch, and satellite dishes extend our ears. In addition, virtual
                               sensors have been used for many years to monitor our computing
                               environments. Smaller and more powerful computer processors allow
                               sensors to be small and inexpensive enough that they can be
                               everywhere. And with the advent of trillions and trillions of IPv6
                               addresses, they can all be networked.
                  </p>
                  <p>147. Networks, human or technological, are designed to communicate
                               information from one point to others. But the value of a network is
                               entirely dependent on the information it contains. And so the
                               sensors that feed information into a network play a crucial role in
                               maximising a network's value. Simply put, the better the sensors and
                               the better the information they provide, the more valuable the
                               network becomes.
                  </p>
                  <p>148. Advanced sensors that report directly about their physical
                               environment will enable truly revolutionary applications. Already
                               there are sensors that can detect, measure, and transmit any
                               physical quality such as temperature, pressure, colour, shape,
                               sound, motion, and chemical composition. And, as sensors are
                               becoming more sophisticated, they are also shrinking in size. Some
                               are so tiny that they are difficult to detect.
                  </p>
                  <p>149. Emerging sensor network technologies will be autonomous,
                               intelligent, and mobile. These sensors will reconfigure themselves
                               to achieve certain tasks. These requirements will provide rigid
                               requirements for the computing, and delivery systems of the future.
                               The networks and computing systems must reorganise themselves to
                               serve the distributed agents with needs to communicate and exchange
                               decisions, actions, and knowledge to other agents in secured
                               environment.

                  <p>150. Service component architecture (SCA) <a class="xref" href="bi01.html#r78" title="Service Component Architecture (SCA)">[25]</a> is a technology
                               development initiative driven by a group of middle-ware vendors. SCA
                               extends and complements existing standards for service
                               implementation and for web services; the goal is to simplify
                               application development and implementation of SOA.
                  </p>
                  <p>151. SCA components operate at a business level and are decoupled
                               from the actual implementation technology and infrastructure used.
                               SCA uses Service Data Objects (SDO) <a class="xref" href="bi01.html#r79" title="Service Data Objects (SDO)">[26]</a> to represent the business
                               data that forms parameters and return value between the services.
                               SCA thus provides uniform Service access and uniform Service data
                               representation.
