               <p>23. This guideline document describes a concept and model for how
                      knowledge of proven solutions in the form of design rules can be
                      documented and packaged in order to form a shared basis for the future
                      development of NNEC based systems for NATO.
               </p>
               <p>24. The processes in which design rules are identified, produced and
                      used are not described within this guideline.

                  <p>25. In the development of large systems of systems or federated
                           systems for the future needs of the NATO there are several problems to
                           be solved as well as opportunities to exploit. The problems range from
                           what methods to use for requirements capture and design to how to solve
                           detailed technical matters.
                  </p>
                  <p>26. In order to be able to establish a set of building blocks that can
                           be used to meet the needs of the future NNEC, design regulations are
                           absolutely essential if the building blocks shall be possible to be used
                           together and combined in different ways, from a technical as well as
                           from a business point of view.
                  </p>
                  <p>27. Design regulations in this context are the descriptive or
                           normative regulation work necessary for NATO nations to be able to
                           implement, configure and use systems in a federated environment. This
                           includes not only technical and business design, but also the ability to
                           manage and maintain these regulations to be able to provide the NATO
                           nations with flexible component based systems.
                  </p>
                  <p>28. Moreover, there is a strong incentive to endorse reuse of proven
                           solutions or implementations and thus get a more cost-effective
                           solution. The overall quality is also expected to benefit from this kind
                           of reuse.
                  </p>
                  <p>29. In this document we will focus on the model for design rules, and
                           the patterns for setting up the SIOP and SIP:s between federations, this
                           in order to be able to exchange information services between
                           parties.
                  </p>
                  <p>30. Design rules patterns and knowledge for supporting NATO Nations in
                           designing NNEC compliant components and services can also be retrieved
                           from different Nations repositories as reference architectures, Sweden
                           Design rules (releasable to NATO) will be included as one of the Partner
                           nations reference architecture as recommended and proven patterns in
                           order to achieve NNEC interoperability.

                     <p>31. Design rules are about reusing knowledge of proven solutions. In
                                the context of NNEC we are especially interested in reuse of solutions
                                that provide typical NNEC characteristics. In addition to this, the
                                use of design rules aim at making the development of NNEC more
                                cost-effective and improve the quality in the resulting
                                products.
                     </p>
                     <p>32. As mentioned before, a design rule is in the most general
                                description a three-part rule, which expresses a relation between a
                                certain context, a problem or an opportunity and a solution.
                     </p>
                     <p>33. Different design rules may be in conflict with each other, e.g.
                                in that the solution of one design rule can be incompatible with the
                                solution of the other.
                     </p>
                     <p>34. Moreover, design rules can be singular or aggregates meaning
                                that it either is an atomic rule or an aggregate of rules that
                                together constitute the rule. The aggregate may include rules on how
                                to combine the possibly conflicting aggregated rules in order to
                                generate a rule according to the current priorities.
                     </p>
                     <p>35. Design rules may be implemented for solutions on different
                                levels. There may be design rules for specific technical design
                                problems or rules, how to handle a major business opportunities. It is
                                however anticipated that the majority of design rules valid for an
                                NNEC-system will be focused on the higher levels.
                     </p>
                     <p>36. Design rules can be used in order to meet functional as well as
                                non-functional needs of the system of interest. It should be clear
                                from all design rules which problem or opportunity it is supposed to
                                solve.

                     <p>38. At least one of the mentioned prerequisites should be fulfilled.
                                There may of course be other valid prerequisites, which will be
                                assessed and used to initiate the design of a design rule.
                     </p>
                     <p>39. Design rules shall consist of either atomic rules or aggregates
                                of rules that together shall constitute the rule. The aggregate may
                                include rules on how to combine the possibly conflicting rules in
                                order to generate a rule according to the priorities.
                     </p>
                     <p>40. An atomic design rule must not contain solutions for more than
                                one subject area, e.g. mixing of business and technical subjects shall
                                be avoided. Detailed technical rules shall in the same way be
                                separated from rules of information or logical nature.
                     </p>
                     <p>41. Design rules shall where applicable be based on concepts and
                                rules in an extended NATO Architecture Framework.
                     </p>
                     <p>42. A design rule shall not be of too low granularity or too trivial
                                in order to avoid an explosion in the number produced of design rules.
                                To achieve the approved mandatory validity, a design rule shall
                                specify the way to solve the problem it is intended for. Rules that
                                can be expressed in single sentences are collected in general sections

                     <p>43. Great efforts shall be made to ensure that the design rule is
                                maintainable. This is primarily achieved by limiting the problem area
                                that the design rule is intended for. More complex problems or
                                opportunities shall be supported by aggregates of rules.

                                for instance in a design rule describing a configuration to use in a
                                specific context or for a specific type of system. If so, the validity
                                of the referenced design rule within the current context shall be

                                hierarchy of packages. A design rule or DRP belongs to one, and only
                                one, DRP.

                                limited to the DRP only; default is however that only the DRP exposes
                                the external visibility for a design rule.

                  <p>56. If the design rule concept is going to be successfully
                           implemented, it is important to understand how they impact the other
                           frameworks and processes used in design. These frameworks and processes
                           also have to be adjusted so it becomes clear as to what is documented
                           where and when.
