               <p>64. This design rule is developed for use in NATO Interoperability
                      Standards &amp; Profiles (NISP) version 4. It is based on experiences from
                      the Swedish Network Based Defence initiative where it extends the design
                      rule for Interoperability <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#dr-mil-ref-drinteroperability" title="DR Interoperability">[2]</a>
                  
                  
                      and the IEAT concept developed within the frame of Multinational
                      Experiment 5<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#dr-mil-ref-ieat" title="IEAT Concept">[3]</a>. The design rule also
                      considers the NATO Information Exchange Gateway (IEG) concept<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#dr-mil-gwimpl" title="Guidance Document on the Implementation of Gateways for Information Exchange between NATO and External CIS Communities">[10]</a>.
               </p>
               <p>65. The design rule is applicable for collaborative federations in the
                      coming 2-6 years which means that it covers both existing systems which
                      won't be replaced as well as new systems which are developed and
                      implemented during this time period.
               </p>
               <p>66. The technical scope for the design rule is the highlighted areas of
                      <a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html#v6f-simpleNNECframework" title="Figure 2.1. Simplified NNEC Technical Services framework with design rule scope">Figure 2.1</a>. The design rule does not
                      describe how to achieve interoperability on the Transport/Network level.
                      Furthermore, it does not cover interoperability on the Community of
                      Interest level. However, when design rules for these levels are created,
                      this design rule will be used as the basis for enabling information
                      exchange via services.

                     <p>67. The design rule should be used when there is a need for several
                                different military actors to cooperate in a federative manor in order
                                to solve a common mission. The key capabilities that this design rule
                                will help enable are:
                     </p>

                        <ul class="itemizedlist">
                           <li class="listitem">
                              <p>Collaborative planning between multiple actors in a

                           </li>
                           <li class="listitem">
                              <p>Collaborative synchronization of execution between multiple

                              </p>
                           </li>
                           <li class="listitem">
                              <p>Collaborative assessment between multiple actors in a

                           </li>
                        </ul>
                     </div>
                     <p>68. The design rule does not address the operational activities
                                needed to achieve the above capabilities, nor does it address the
                                Community Of Interest (COI) technical services which supports these
                                activities. Instead the design rule describes a set of principles,
                                technologies and activities needed to create a technical platform
                                which enables information exchange between the actors and can act as a
                                foundation for the COI specific technical services when these are to
                                be developed and deployed.
                     </p>
                     <p>69. Since the design rule captures knowledge from previous
                                experiences in this area it can save time and money for the involved
                                actors. If the design rule is applied when defining the profile for
                                such a mission, less time will be spent on getting to agreement on
                                which services and underpinning technologies shall be used in the
                                mission.
                     </p>
                     <p>70. Many of the activities and technologies described in this design
                                rule can also be applied when exchanging information and services with
                                other actors than military organizations. However, there are specific
                                aspects of collaborating with this type of organizations which are not
                                covered by this design rule.
                     </p>
                     <p>71. A suitable definition of interoperability in this design rule
                                context (i.e. technical context) is: The ability of technical systems
                                and/or organizations using technical systems to operate together by
                                making (necessary) data &amp; information and/or services produced by
                                one system or organization available to the others, in an agreed
                                format.
                     </p>

                  <div class="sect3" title="2.2.1.2. The International Military Federation">

                     </div>
                     <p>72. There are many challenges that have to be overcome in order to
                                make collaborative work and knowledge sharing among the actors in an
                                operation successful. In <a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html#v6s-solution" title="2.2.3. Solution">Section 2.2.3</a> of this
                                design rule mainly addresses the technical aspects of the
                                establishment of federation in which collaborating actors can exchange
                                information. However, organizational, process and legislation aspects
                                must be covered to some extent since all of these needs to be
                                harmonized in order to make the collaboration effective. Therefore, a
                                number of non-technical issues are described in <a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html#v6s-problem" title="2.2.2. Problem">Section 2.2.2</a>.
                     </p>
                     <p>73. The federation, depicted in <a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html#v6f-fedoverview" title="Figure 2.2. Federation Overview">Figure 2.2</a>,
                                is where the collaborating actors provide services which the other
                                actors can consume. To create a federation, the actors need to create
                                a federation agreement which defines the rules of the federation, such
                                as which data formats, information classifications should be used.
                                Rules regarding information ownership and service levels (including
                                quality of service) are also included in the federation
                                agreement.
                     </p>
                     <p>74. Collaboration in multilateral operations has previously been
                                based on bi-lateral agreements between all participants, but in order
                                to achieve the speed and flexibility needed today, there is a need to
                                establish a baseline federation agreement which can be used as a
                                starting point when creating new missions.
                     </p>
                     <p>75. Actors which participate in the federation connect networks and
                                systems within their responsibility (i.e. domain) to other actors in
                                order to be able to exchange information. To protect the internal
                                information and control which information is being exchanged one or
                                more Information Exchange Gateways (IEG) are stood up between the
                                federation and the actors' network. In the IEG, one or more
                                service interfaces are physically instantiated. This is referred to as
                                a Service Interoperability Point (SIOP) according to the NATO C3
                                System Architecture Framework <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#dr-mil-ref-nc3saf" title="NATO C3 System Architecture Framework">[6]</a>.
                     </p>
                     <p>76. Within an actor's domain there can be one or more
                                networks where information is stored. The decision which internal
                                networks shall be connected is taken by each actor (Federation member)
                                independently of the other actors. In <a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html#v6f-fedoverview" title="Figure 2.2. Federation Overview">Figure 2.2</a> two example networks are depicted, one
                                federation network which holds information only relevant to the
                                federation and one which is the actors' internal network. In
                                this case, the IEG handles information exchange between these two
                                networks as well as information exchange with other actors
                                IEGs.

                     <p>79. <span class="bold"><strong>Flexibility</strong></span>: The requirements
                                on interoperability will change over time. Also, in some situations,
                                very limited time will be available for making the necessary
                                modifications of the system in order to fulfil the new requirements.
                                This means that the organization, security and technical systems need
                                to be very flexible with respect to configuration and modifiability in
                                order to be able to adapt to changing and extended interoperability

                                interoperability follows information security risks that must be
                                handled. The connection of external systems must be done in such a way
                                that the information security of each nation or organisation is not
                                compromised. However information security mechanisms cannot be allowed
                                to be static. In each specific case the need to protect information
                                must be balanced against the possible consequences from not sharing
                                the information. The three aspects of security; confidentiality
                                integrity and availability, must all be considered.

                  <p>81. There are several challenges to the effort of creating a
                           federation for collaboration between military partners, both related to
                           technology, but also related to how organizations, humans and
                           legislation systems work.
                  </p>
                  <p>82. This chapter summarizes the basic requirements for the federation
                           and identifies the challenges which must be overcome in order to
                           establish the federation. The issues identified for these challenges are
                           given an answer to in <a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html#v6s-solution" title="2.2.3. Solution">Section 2.2.3</a>.

                           elementary (information exchange) requirements which are set on all
                           international military federations. This is not a complete list, but
                           these requirements acts as a driver for identifying the basic set of
                           technologies needed in a federation.

                  <p>84. Information and services exchange between nations and
                           organisations (e.g. unclassified, restricted, secret and top secret
                           classification) is based on government agreement between nations and
                           organisations. Qualified information and services exchange can only take
                           place if such agreement exists. To achieve this agreement is a lengthy
                           process that often takes many months to finalize. It has also been
                           proven complicated to negotiate and sign such an agreement between more
                           than two nations and organisations at a time (multilateral). Nations are
                           willing to share more information and services with some parties and
                           less with others. This creates complicated situations during
                           multilateral operations.

                  <p>85. Differing laws, rules and regulations together with different
                           cultures regarding information sharing are likely to impact willingness
                           to share information and slow down process of getting agreements on what
                           to share.

                  <p>86. Parties participating in a multilateral operation are likely to
                           have different requirements and priorities which will imply different
                           scope and granularity of information exchange for each party. The
                           parties will be required to protect their national integrity while
                           sharing information with the other parties. By this, it is likely that
                           the parties wish to get access to more information and services than
                           they are willing to provide themselves. It is also so that the parties
                           will need to limit the possibilities for others to control how and what

                  <p>87. Semantic differences, i.e. differences in languages and the
                           meaning of words and expressions, are likely to be an issue when
                           exchanging information. If the collaborating parties cannot understand
                           the information being communicated, the information will not be of any
                           use and the trust of accessible information will be challenged. There is
                           a need for the parties to eventually meet in a combined opinion, a
                           common and agreed set of descriptions in order to reach wanted
                           effects.
                  </p>
                  <p>88. In order to solve the semantic challenge there is a need to
                           understand the content of information and services exchanged between
                           different systems/actors to be able to come to an agreement of the
                           meaning of the information. However, the increasing requirements of the
                           ability to rapidly change directions of the flow of information, as well
                           as the actual content, means that the work with defining models and
                           requirements for information exchange must be done continuously and

                  <p>89. Architecture and technical implementations of information systems
                           will be different in most of the cases. The complete technical system
                           will probably not be homogenous, rather a federation of heterogeneous
                           systems and therefore hard to govern and manage.
                  </p>
                  <p>90. Agreeing on standards, formats and mechanisms for information
                           exchange is a critical success factor, however the sovereignty of the
                           parties will increase the complexity of this task since there is no
                           governing organ that can make the decisions.
                  </p>
                  <p>91. A common understanding and agreement on the architecture and
                           design for the federation is vital in order to succeed with agreeing on
                           how information shall be exchanged. A major challenge in this
                           perspective is that the maturity of using architecture and design as
                           governing tools is likely to vary greatly among collaborating parties,
                           thus slowing down the agreement process.
                  </p>
                  <p>92. Since each actor has huge amounts of data of various kinds within

                        <p>104. In the Framework, there are seven major perspectives (i.e.,
                                     views) that logically combine to describe the architecture of an
                                     enterprise. These are the NATO All View (NAV), NATO Capability View
                                     (NCV), NATO Programme View (NPV), NATO Operational View (NOV), NATO
                                     Systems View (NSV), NATO Service-Oriented View (NSOV) and NATO
                                     Technical View (NTV). Each of the seven views depicts certain
                                     architecture attributes. Some attributes bridge several views and
                                     provide integrity, coherence, and consistency to architecture
                                     descriptions.
                        </p>
                        <p>105. To support the creation of views and make sure they are
                                     consistent, NAF v3 defines a metamodel. The NATO Architecture
                                     Framework Metamodel (NMM) defines the relationships between the
                                     different components of the framework. It defines the architectural
                                     objects and components that are permitted in NAF v3 views and their
                                     relationships with each other.

                                     designing architectures for multinational operations where
                                     interoperability is in focus <a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html#issue10">[Issue_10]</a>:

                                     capture aspects which overarch all other views. These views set the
                                     scope and context of the architecture, such as goals and vision,
                                     scenario and environmental conditions as well as time.

                                     strategic intent for the mission. Specifically, capabilities related
                                     to interaction between actors are important to identify in these
                                     views. If produced correctly, these views can already say a lot of
                                     which services are needed to fulfil the business needs. In
                                     particular, the NCV-2, Capability Taxonomy and NCV-7, Capability to
                                     Services Mapping views are important.

                                     which is a description of the tasks and activities, operational
                                     elements, and information exchanges required to accomplish NATO
                                     missions. To design for interoperability all of these views do not
                                     have to be complete, but it is important to know which operational
                                     nodes exist and how they interact (NOV-2). Also, the information
                                     model defined in the NOV-7 view is important, especially for such
                                     information for which there are no or unclear standards to rely on.
                                     When going into more details of the architecture, the requirements
                                     on information exchange (NOV-3) are necessary to understand.

                                     modelling of services. The authors of this design rule recommends
                                     that future versions of NAF are complemented with the capabilities
                                     of using services to describe interaction between operational nodes
                                     instead of needlines.

                                           (NSOV)</strong></span> focuses strictly on identifying and describing
                                     services. The view also supports the description of service
                                     taxonomies, service orchestrations and a mapping of services to
                                     operational activities. The service description (NSOV-2) is a key
                                     component of a Service Oriented Architecture <a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html#principle6">[Principle_6]</a>. It is used to detach the functionality
                                     provided by a system (or services provided by an organizational
                                     unit) from the actual system. A service description includes
                                     information on how to interact with the service, what requirements a
                                     system must fulfil if it implements the service and what information
                                     model the services uses. Within NSOV-2 a SIOP can be depicted as a
                                     higher-level service interface. The detailed technical specification
                                     of a SIOP is contained within a Service Interoperability Profile
                                     (SIP). SIPs are addressed in NTV-1 Technical Standards
                                     Profile.

                                     of the required information exchanged between operational nodes.
                                     IERs are identified in the business modelling process and specify
                                     the elements of the user information used in support of a particular
                                     activity. The specification is done according to the NOV-3 view of

                                     information which are exchanged between operational nodes. IEMs are
                                     used when deciding which information objects are to be exchanged in
                                     service interactions. The specification is done according to the
                                     NOV-7 view of NAF<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#dr-mil-ref-naf3" title="NATO Architecture Framework (NAF)">[9]</a>.

                        <p>127. An IEM is constructed top-down based on model elements from
                                     other existing Information Models e.g. standards as well as
                                     bottom-up based on information requirements specifications from

                        </p>
                        <p>128. When designing Information Exchange Models several different
                                     approaches exist:
                        </p>

                              <li class="listitem">
                                 <p>Ontology based e.g. Semantic web</p>
                              </li>
                              <li class="listitem">
                                 <p>Message based e.g. ADatP-3</p>
                              </li>

                        <p>129. Given the timeframe for this design rule, a model based
                                     approach is the best approach considering what the technology can
                                     handle and results from ongoing modelling work. The ontology based
                                     approach can be adopted at a later stage when the technology and
                                     methods are more mature while the message based approach is to be
                                     avoided if possible since it cannot handle the complexity of
                                     integrated models.

                                     information models. Each translation is based on thorough analysis
                                     and is documented in a translation specification together with
                                     estimates of information loss.
                        </p>

                                     contained and treated as one unit. The content structure may vary in
                                     complexity from the simplest form with a number of data elements and
                                     an identifier to complex data structures and large quantities of
                                     data elements. Examples of information objects are documents,
                                     messages and data sets such as geographical data sets.
                        </p>
                        <p>134. Information objects are created, processed, stored and
                                     moved/exchanged via services. An information exchange object is a
                                     standardised view, or an excerpt from, an information exchange model
                                     which from a technical point of view is suitable to exchange as a
                                     coherent set. Thus information exchange objects is a subset of all
                                     information objects which are meant to be exchanged via
                                     services.

                                     stored and moved/exchanged via services. Therefore it is important
                                     to understand the architectural relationship between services and
                                     information. I.e. how are services and information specified in
                                     order to enable the implementation of a service oriented
                                     architecture.

                                     has operations. They are used for specification of how a consumer
                                     can interact with the service, for example create, read, update,
                                     delete. An operation requires one or more information objects to be
                                     exchanged between the consumer and provider, for example a message
                                     or a document. These exchange objects are excerpts from an
                                     information exchange model.

                                it is of outmost importance to analyse the information which needs to
                                be assured. This is important in order to avoid a "too
                                secure" solution, thus introducing higher costs and more
                                difficult procedures than needed. The flexibility which is introduced
                                by the NNEC concept requires a constant analysis of the need for
                                information confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA). Also,
                                time needs to be considered in these analyses, i.e. how long does the
                                information need to be protected.
                     </p>
                     <p>139. This design rule does not cover how to perform CIA analyses, but
                                it is certain that there is a need to be able to handle different
                                levels of security in the federation. A set of scenarios has been
                                defined in the IEG concept<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#dr-mil-gwimpl" title="Guidance Document on the Implementation of Gateways for Information Exchange between NATO and External CIS Communities">[10]</a> which are
                                used in this design rule to handle difference in security

                     <p>140. Information Exchange Gateways (IEGs) are used to protect
                                information assets of the participants in the federation. Since each
                                participant provides an IEG to protect their assets there is a need to
                                standardise the services and the architecture of IEGs in order to
                                enable sharing of IEG components between the participants and use of
                                commercially available technology. The NATO IEG concept<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#dr-mil-gwimpl" title="Guidance Document on the Implementation of Gateways for Information Exchange between NATO and External CIS Communities">[10]</a> describes that each IEG has three major
                                services:
                     </p>
                     <p>141. "The first is the Node Protection Service (NPS). The NPS
                                provides protection to the infrastructure; its purpose is to protect
                                the physical assets of the "node" or nation being
                                protected by the IEG."
                     </p>
                     <p>142. "The second major component/service is the Information
                                Protection Service (IPS). NATO and each nation are responsible for
                                protecting the flow of information out of its area (node or network).
                                The mechanisms used to protect the information flow must satisfy the
                                organization (nation or NATO) that the IEG is
                                protecting."
                     </p>
                     <p>143. "The third major component/service is the Information
                                Exchange Service (IES). The IEG must facilitate the flow of
                                information between the protected node/network and the external
                                organizations that are authorized (by the Information Protection

                     <p>145. Information Zones is a concept identified and defined  to achieve confidentiality with high assurance, for a gathering
                                of information within a defined perimeter, and interactions to its
                                surrounding with a number of services and nodes inside the zone. The
                                concept gives the advantage to separate assurance on security
                                mechanisms to meet external and internal threats.
                     </p>
                     <p>146. In a federative approach such as the one described in this
                                design rule, each federation participant (actor) is to be considered
                                as (at least) one information zone. The reason for this is that there
                                is a clear responsibility for information and information management
                                within each actor. At the border of the information zones there are
                                Information Exchange Gateways (IEG) which protects the information
                                within the zone and allows controlled sharing of information between
                                information zones. See <a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html#v6f-fedinfozones" title="Figure 2.4. Informationzones in the federation">Figure 2.4</a>.

                     </div><br class="figure-break" /><p>147. The information classification level in each zone will differ
                                and therefore the information assurance level needs to be adjusted
                                accordingly. I.e. the more sensitive information within a zone, the
                                more protection and dissemination control is needed.
                     </p>
                     <p>148. By basing the security on information zones with boundary
                                protection and controlled information flow and access to the zone, it
                                is made easier to achieve high assurance since only a few mechanisms,
                                i.e. the IEG, needs to be inspected/evaluated to meet the security
                                requirement.
                     </p>
                     <p>149. In the federation there may be several information zones
                                depending on the classification of exchanged information. However, the
                                number of information zones should be kept to a minimum in order to
                                avoid unnecessary costs and complexity for implementation and

                                capabilities are needed. First of all, there must be network (IP)
                                connectivity between the actors in the federation; however this is not
                                covered by this design rule. Once network connectivity is established,
                                the technical systems of the actors need to be able to publish and
                                find the services which are to be used. Of course, all communication
                                in the federation network must be secured by relevant security
                                mechanisms.

                                be able to find each other and once they have done that they can start
                                collaborating.

                                information, Messaging Services can be used. In some cases the
                                information models used by the different actors does not match and
                                then the Translation Services are used to translate the
                                content.

                     <p>156. Lastly, it is important for the actors in the federation to know
                                the status of the services in the federation, especially if there are
                                mission critical services which are provided by other actors.

                        <p>158. The Service registry enables the technical systems to discover
                                     each other. The service registry is a vital part needed for enabling
                                     the loose coupling between systems since it provides functionality
                                     for the systems to find each other , with such registry the
                                     relationships between the systems does not need to be hard coded
                                     into the systems. This means that it will be easy to add or remove
                                     participants and services from the federation.
                        </p>

                        <p>161. Each actor in a federation holds information which might be
                                     relevant to other actors. Therefore it is of outmost importance that
                                     there are mechanisms to discover information across actors. These
                                     mechanisms have to include the capability for an actor to decide
                                     which information shall be available to others according to <a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html#principle1">[Principle_1]</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html#principle2">[Principle_2]</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>162. There are mainly two ways of making the information discovery
                                     happen. One is to copy information between actors and let each actor
                                     make the information searchable, but this is not very efficient
                                     since it requires a lot of bandwidth and makes it hard to keep track
                                     of which information has been copied.
                        </p>
                        <p>163. The other way of enabling information discovery is to use a
                                     federated search pattern where each actor provides a search
                                     interface to its information. This is much more efficient from a
                                     data distribution point of view, but requires that all actors come
                                     to agreement on the search interface. There are initiatives ongoing
                                     to standardise the ability to perform federated search, the most
                                     prominent one is the OpenSearch initiative<sup>[<a id="d0e1698" href="#ftn.d0e1698" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup>. Even though OpenSearch is not a formal standard it is
                                     well on its way to be adopted by many of the major tool
                                     vendors.
                        </p>
                        <p>164. In either case, the actors in the federation must implement
                                     search engines which can index information (if the have any) and
                                     search clients which can access the search engines. A search client
                                     is in most cases an ordinary web browser, but can also be a more
                                     complex application if there are specific needs.

                        <p>165. A metadata registry is a database which contains information
                                     about information which is useful for enabling information
                                     discovery. For example, search engines create metadata registries
                                     when they index content. But there are also other applications for
                                     metadata registries, like when an actor has sensitive information
                                     which needs to be able to be discovered. Say that there is a
                                     database which contains classified analyses of some sort. The
                                     analyses are of very good quality and can be of use to many, but it
                                     is impossible to publish them to everyone in the federation. So in
                                     order to make other actors aware that the analysis exists,
                                     unclassified analysis metadata, like what the analysis looks at and
                                     who has done it, can be published in a metadata repository. Now the
                                     other actors can discover that there is an analysis and contact the
                                     author to get approval for getting the contents.
                        </p>

                                     it enables people to find each other. The user directory holds
                                     information which enables authentication of users by certificates
                                     and public keys, authorization of users by roles and discovery of
                                     users by contact information which enables collaboration.

                                     users that represents them. However, it is preferable if the
                                     federation has one point of access to all user directories.
                                     Therefore, the implementation of user directories in a federation
                                     shall follow the federated database pattern. This means that each
                                     actor provides their own database, but one actor provides a single
                                     entry point to all databases.

                        <p>171. E-mail has become one of the most important applications for
                                     any business or organization of today. The main challenge for using
                                     e-mail in a federation is to be able to control that no classified
                                     information is embedded or attached to e-mails going out from an
                                     actor and protecting the actors from malicious software, such as
                                     viruses. This means that the IEG needs to be able to scan and filter
                                     incoming and outgoing messages.
                        </p>
                        <p>172. Extra care needs to be taken for outgoing information where
                                     confidential information can be hidden in document history and
                                     inside images. Therefore, only text-based attachments (like
                                     OpenDocument Format or Office Open XML, see NISP<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#dr-mil-ref-nisp-vol3v3" title="NISP Volume 3, Version 3">[12]</a>) without inserted code or images
                                     shall be allowed through the IEG.
                        </p>
                        <p>173. It is also vital to have a manual inspection capability in the
                                     IEG to be able to assess the degree of confidentiality of the e-mail
                                     messages leaving an actor.
                        </p>
                        <p>174. As described by NISP<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#dr-mil-ref-nisp-vol3v3" title="NISP Volume 3, Version 3">[12]</a>,
                                     SMTP according to RFC 2821 and others SHALL be used for e-mail. To
                                     secure communication between SMTP agents, TLS according to RFC 3207,
                                     SHOULD be used.

                                           service</strong></span></p>
                        <p>175. For instant messaging XMPP (IETF RFC3920:2004 -3923:2004)
                                     SHALL be used according to NISP<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#dr-mil-ref-nisp-vol3v3" title="NISP Volume 3, Version 3">[12]</a>. XMPP is an XML based
                                     publish/subscribe protocol which is used by most of the dominant
                                     tool vendors. Using XML enables possibility for inspection and
                                     control of messages in IEGs which is very important in a
                                     federation.
                        </p>
                        <p>176. There is one important aspect of XMPP which is not covered by
                                     the current standard specification; there is no security tagging
                                     options available which is needed when messages shall be passed
                                     between information zones with different security classifications.
                                     So if this is required a custom extension to XMPP needs to be
                                     defined.
                        </p>
                        <p>177. Another thing which must be considered in a federation is
                                     routing of messages. Currently there are no XMPP servers which
                                     support routing of XMPP messages. This consequence of not being able
                                     to route messages is that the IEG has to be implemented as a
                                     transparent proxy, i.e. the systems on the outside of the IEG need
                                     to know about the systems on the inside. Even though the IEG can be
                                     used for inspection and filtering of messages in this case; it is
                                     not always a preferred solution from a security perspective. So, if
                                     the security requirements say that the IEG needs to act as a
                                     non-transparent proxy, the XMPP server needs to be modified to be
                                     able to act as an XMPP server and be able to route messages between
                                     XMPP domains.

                        <p>178. In order to achieve an efficient exchange of information
                                     between the actors in a federation there is a need to be able to
                                     route and distribute messages. This type of capability is often
                                     included in the Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) concept.
                        </p>
                        <p>179. An ESB refers to a software architecture construct,
                                     implemented by technologies found in a category of middleware
                                     infrastructure products usually based on Web services standards that
                                     provides foundational services for more complex service-oriented
                                     architectures.
                        </p>
                        <p>180. An ESB generally provides an abstraction layer on top of an
                                     implementation of an Enterprise Messaging System which allows
                                     integration architects to exploit the value of messaging without
                                     writing code.
                        </p>
                        <p>181. The ESB shall enable endpoints to interact in their native
                                     interaction modes through the bus. It shall support a variety of
                                     endpoint protocols and interaction styles. These interaction
                                     patterns are the least which shall be supported:

                                                  model, so a request/response interaction is handled by two
                                                  related one-way message flows -- one for the request and one for
                                                  the response.

                                     some things which must be considered. First, the products which
                                     realize the messaging and mediation capabilities needs to be the
                                     same everywhere since there are very small chances of realizing
                                     integration between two different products due to a lack of
                                     standardization. This means that the federation agreement must
                                     include which product to use.
                        </p>
                        <p>185. Secondly, the management of rules for transformation of
                                     messages needs to be considered. ESB and messaging products are
                                     often built for central management of transformation rules, thus
                                     enabling a better control over the messaging capabilities in an
                                     enterprise. However, this can be problematic in a federative
                                     approach since all actors need to agree on the transformation rules
                                     or appoint one actor which has the authority to manage these.

                        <p>186. Translation is about manipulating messages in-flight between a
                                     service provider and a consumer (requests or events). This means
                                     that messages dispatched by a requester are transformed into
                                     messages understood by a slightly incompatible provider selected
                                     from a set of potential endpoints.

                        <p>196. In a federation, the participants may be able to managed
                                     systems and services provided by other participants, but this is
                                     unlikely due to information responsibility of organizations. I.e. a
                                     participant which is responsible for the information within its
                                     information zone will not let another actor have administrative
                                     privileges to the system where this information resides.
                        </p>
                        <p>197. However, sharing monitoring information between the
                                     participants is essential if the Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
                                     shall be fulfilled. These SLAs are included in the agreements for
                                     information exchange as specified by <a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html#principle3">[Principle_3]</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>198. Monitoring information is to be provided using the Simple
                                     Network Management Protocol version 3 (SNMP v3) standard according
                                     to NISP<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#dr-mil-ref-nisp-vol3v3" title="NISP Volume 3, Version 3">[12]</a>. Using a non-XML
                                     based format for monitoring, like SNMP, will require a special
                                     filtering engine in the IEG IPS (see chapter <a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html#v6s-infassserv" title="2.2.3.5.7. Information Assurance Services">Section 2.2.3.5.7</a>).
                        </p>
                        <p>199. It is important to set the monitoring scope properly when
                                     implementing the monitoring solution in order to avoid dissemination
                                     of to much information into the federation. Therefore, monitoring
                                     information SHALL only be provided regarding the services which are
